Identity Verification using Answering Correctness and Behavior for Geo-Location Entities (Roads and Points of Interest) Relevant to a User's Primary Address,"The Geographical Knowledge Based Verification (GeoKBA) System is an advanced multifactor verification service integrating a geographical component with digital behavioral biometrics to verify user identities in web-based interfaces. Conventional multifactor authentication (MFA) consists of “something you know” (e.g., a password) and “something you have” (e.g., a cell phone that receives a temporary code) to greatly enhance verification accuracy. GeoKBA extends this model, employing “something you know” and “something you do” by simultaneously testing users on two factors relative to their familiarity with specific geographic locations (i.e., geo-targets), assessing responses in terms of objective accuracy as well as behavioral patterns exhibited while providing those responses. The GeoKBA approach greatly increases accuracy and security over single factor approaches and presents and collects these dual factors in a single process for a better user experience. Unlike existing KBA methods, the GeoKBA approach will work with first touch users (e.g., account opening) or repeat users (e.g., password reset). The evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates innovations like GeoKBA, which not only act as an additional protective layer but also anticipate and counter newer hacking methods by rooting identity verification in the real-world attribute of geographical location.","The alarming rate of hacking incidents and the sophisticated techniques employed by cybercriminals underscore the pressing need for reinforced identity verification methods to protect internet users as they exchange and store sensitive personal information and financial data. By leveraging geographical data, which is inherently difficult for hackers to replicate or misuse, GeoKBA addresses one of the core vulnerabilities in conventional verification methods. This combination of “knowing” and “doing” ensures a multi-dimensional authentication process. As online interfaces evolve and the demand for secure transactions grows, technologies like GeoKBA become indispensable in maintaining the integrity and security of digital transactions. ​​​​​​​",Software & Information Technology

Created by a team of interdisciplinary researchers at the University of Arizona, NEPAccess allows for the comprehensive analysis of environmental data in one unique system for the first time.",Software & Information Technology
Development of Milk-Based Kefir using a Combination of Probiotic Lactobacilli Bacteria and the Dairy Yeast Kluyveromyces Marxianus var. Lactis (K. Lactis),"This innovation is a milk-based Kefir created from a popular commercial lactobacilli (LAB) culture mixed with the probiotic yeast <em>K. lactis</em>. Experimental formulations involved different amounts of <em>K. lactis</em> to find the optimal balance and various tests assessed the quality of the Kefir, such as measuring cell counts, pH levels, acidity, lactose content, and sensory analysis. The final Kefir prototypes matched the control product and also met the criteria for being considered probiotic, with higher viable cell counts and reduced lactose levels. These findings suggest that incorporating new probiotics into familiar dairy products could be a promising way to enhance probiotic intake and make products more accessible to a broader audience.","Probiotics have gained recognition for their potential health benefits, but traditional dairy products often lack sufficient probiotic content. Additionally, lactose intolerance is a common issue, particularly among certain populations. Current solutions involve using commercial LAB cultures, but they may not always achieve desired probiotic levels or adequately address lactose intolerance concerns. By incorporating the probiotic yeast <em>K. lactis </em>alongside traditional LAB cultures, the product achieves higher probiotic counts and lower lactose levels, meeting the criteria for being considered probiotic. This approach offers a more effective means of delivering probiotics while simultaneously addressing lactose intolerance concerns. It provides a viable alternative to conventional methods, potentially expanding the accessibility and appeal of probiotic-rich dairy products to a wider audience.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Cow's Milk Yogurt made using Saccharomyces Cerevisiae var. Boulardii promotes Probiotic Levels and Extends GI Health Benefits,"This innovation incorporates <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>, a probiotic yeast, into dairy products such as yogurt and kefir. With consumers seeking more options to increase their probiotic intake, the research aimed to investigate if <em>S. boulardii </em>could grow alongside traditional yogurt and kefir cultures to create products that meet both sensory standards and regulatory requirements. Through trials varying the levels of <em>S. boulardii </em>in combination with the traditional cultures, researchers successfully produced yogurt and kefir with acceptable characteristics in terms of taste, texture, and probiotic viability. These findings suggest that incorporating novel probiotics like <em>S. boulardii</em> into mainstream dairy products could offer an effective means of enhancing probiotic consumption among the general population.","As consumers increasingly seek ways to boost their probiotic intake for improved gut health, they have few options for probiotic yeasts, particularly in food and beverages. Current options predominantly focus on bacterial probiotics, such as supplements or foods containing bacterial strains like <em>Lactobacillus </em>and <em>Bifidobacterium</em>. However, these options don't fully cater to those who may prefer or benefit from yeast-based probiotics. The innovation lies in incorporating <em>S. boulardii </em>into familiar dairy products like yogurt and kefir, making it more accessible and palatable to consumers accustomed to these items. Integrating <em>S. boulardii</em> into these mainstream products broadens the range of available probiotics while leveraging the familiarity and popularity of yogurt and kefir to encourage greater consumption of beneficial yeasts. This approach potentially addresses the limitations of current products by offering a convenient and familiar way for consumers to incorporate probiotic yeasts into their diets, thereby promoting gut health more effectively.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Bea Breast Density Bioelectrical Impedance Device Attachment,"This technology is a device which applies bioelectrical impedance (BIA) principles to the breast for an estimate of breast density in order to provide a new screening tool for detection of breast cancer. BIA technology is applied to the limited area of breast as opposed to whole body measurements commonly used to assess adiposity. The goal of the breast BIA device is to reduce breast cancer health disparities by enabling a ""pre-screening"" of breast density (without radiation) that would indicate whether standard mammography screening should be undertaken. Populations particularly targeted will be those in low resource settings as well as younger (under age of 40) Hispanic and African American women who have a higher prevalence of early onset breast cancer.","BIA is most commonly used for whole body assessment of excess adiposity, i.e. obesity. BIA is not currently used as a screening tool for breast cancer, though breast tissue is largely made up of fat and water. Mammography is the current clinical standard for breast cancer risk assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed breast density works on the principles of fat and water and is being developed as an alternative to mammography for breast cancer risk assessment. MRI does not introduce radiation whereas mammography screening does introduce radiation. There is no radiation exposure with BIA either. In fact, BIA current is imperceptible and no side effects have been demonstrated; it is essentially non-invasive. BIA also has the advantage of being able to be small and highly portable and, therefore, amenable to field screenings which are important for rural areas and other underserved populations.",Healthcare Portfolios
Synthesis of Novel Au(II) Dimers and Investigation of their Potential for Applications in Cancer Treatment,This invention is a method of synthesis of novel Au(II) dimer with pyridine dipyrrolinone (H2PYDP) ligands which demonstrate antiproliferative activity in ovarian cancers. This compound operates with a different mechanism than similar existing drugs allowing for novel combinational drug therapies to be created and tested.,"It is estimated that in 2024, about 19,680 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and about 12,740 women will die from ovarian cancer. For those in remission, more than 80% of ovarian cancer patients experience recurrent disease, and more than 50% of these patients die from the disease in less than five years post-diagnosis. For years, cisplatin and other platinum-based anticancer drugs have remained the drugs of choice for treating ovarian cancer with a variety of combinational options. Despite the initial success of these drugs, cisplatin falls short in its ability to maintain efficacy. To address the resistance to cisplatin, these novel Au(II) dimers with newer mechanistic approaches are likely to provide new avenues for ovarian cancer therapies.",Life Sciences
Apparatus and Method for Closed Loop Control of Heliostat Motion,"This invention is an apparatus and method for controlling the motion of heliostats, which are mirrors that reflect sunlight towards a common target. For heliostats to be maximally efficient, they must be able to shift in orientation precisely as the Sun’s relative position to the Earth changes. This technology utilizes a beamsplitter perpendicular to a heliostat reflector surface and to the incident and reflected rays of sunlight, as well as a camera that views both the sunlight transmitted through the beamsplitter and the sunlight reflected from the beamsplitter. By applying the law of reflection, the system ensures that the images of the sun and the target captured by the camera share a common center when the heliostat is correctly oriented. A computer processes these images to continuously adjust the heliostat’s orientation, maintaining accurate targeting of the reflected sunlight. The integrated dual-axis mount and automatic mechanical shape adjustment significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of solar energy collection.","Numerous heliostat tracking and orientation correction methods currently exist, including open loop methods, which calculate the necessary orientations of each heliostat in a tower or field based on relative positions of the Earth and Sun and the precise location of the heliostat. However, these methods are imprecise and cannot account for irregularities or imperfections in the heliostat, or for uneven or rocky ground beneath a heliostat tower or field. Closed loop methods of heliostat control, in which the heliostat’s degree of unalignment is continuously calculated using sensors and cameras and then corrected, are more effective and precise than open loop methods, but many current methods require cameras with very wide fields of view, which have relatively low resolution and high distortion. This limits the accuracy of most current closed loop heliostat orientation control to greater than 1 milliradian milliseconds. This technology, using a camera in conjunction with a beamsplitter on the heliostat reflector, can achieve an accuracy of less than 0.5 milliradian milliseconds.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Rigid Tube Stabilizer System (RTSS),"The invention is a rigid tube stabilizer system (RTSS) and three-ring release system to deploy RTSS to prevent entanglement with a drogue parachute during main canopy deployment. The RTSS unit is placed on the front of an individual who hand-deploys the system, activating a rigid tube that disallows entanglement with the system webbing, promoting free fall stability. Designed for skydivers, aviators, and anyone who uses parachutes to deliver people or payloads, this technology will significantly improve parachute deployment safety.","When gear or skydivers are dropped from any altitude there is a potential of entanglement. An entanglement malfunction disallows the main parachute to deploy appropriately and provide a soft landing for gear or people which can lead to catastrophe. At near space altitudes or lower density atmospheres of other planets, this becomes a huge safety concern. Less dense molecules in an atmosphere disallow proper inflation of stabilization drogue parachutes. The RTSS unit system addresses these safety issues to promote fewer canopy deployment errors and enhance free fall stability.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Method and Apparatus for Collaborative Error Correction using Quantum LDPC Codes and Message Exchange Among Iterative Decoders,"Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are the leading candidate for performing error correction in scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. This invention is a novel method and apparatus for collaborative decoders using QLDPC codes. These quantum decoders pass messages not only within the individual decoders that correct specific error types but also exchange information amongst each other to collaboratively correct multiple error types with excellent decoding performance and speed. Collaborative decoders using QLDPC codes will exchange information amongst each other in an iterative fashion aiding them to correct errors in larger numbers than the state-of-the-art decoder as well as in a faster way than when they work alone. This collaborative approach allows for the correction of multiple error types simultaneously, significantly increasing the number of correctable errors and enhancing the decoding speed compared to existing state-of-the-art decoders.","Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that can be used for more applications than classical computers, but it is prone to errors due to quantum decoherence and other noise sources. Error correction is crucial for the development of practical quantum computers. QLDPC codes are a leading candidate for error correction because of their efficiency and scalability. Traditional QLDPC decoders, however, face limitations in correcting errors quickly and effectively, especially when multiple types of errors occur. The collaborative decoders in this invention address these limitations by enabling decoders to share information and work together iteratively. This results in faster and more robust error correction, paving the way for more reliable and scalable quantum computing systems.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Radiative Cooling and Air Conditioning System with Enhanced Efficiency and Humidity Resilience,"This technology is a radiative cooling and air conditioning (RC/AC) system that is highly efficient, performs under humid conditions, and is minimally impacted by parasitic heating (inherent loss of energy due to inefficiencies in an RC/AC system). These benefits are accomplished through the incorporation of three innovative components in the RC/AC system: a broadband solar reflector capable of reflecting the entire solar spectrum which makes daytime radiative cooling possible; the use of fluids and gasses with high thermal emissivity as the working fluid, making heat exchange between the system and surrounding environment as efficient as possible; and an angular shield designed to block incoming thermal radiation and reduce the impacts of water vapor on cooling efficiency, minimizing the impacts of parasitic heating and allowing for efficient operation in humid environments. The compact design of the system makes it ideal for use in commercial and residential settings.","Air conditioning systems have many limitations, such as electrical issues, leaking ducts, and/or refrigerant leaks or low levels that cause the unit to underperform or not function properly, all while expending additional energy and increasing cost to users. High humidity can make it difficult for AC units to effectively cool because it's more difficult to remove moisture from the air. This system addresses the key limitations of current AC systems while reducing energy consumption, providing an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional air conditioning systems.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Non-Invasive Biomedical Pressure Measurement Using Ultrasound-Induced Acousto-Optic Modulation,"This invention is a novel method for measuring pressure inside the body without invasive procedures that combines ultrasound and laser technologies through the acousto-optic effect. By combining ultrasound and laser technologies, it offers a safe and accurate way to assess pressure levels in biological environments. An ultrasound wave is directed at the target area, such as the eye or brain tissue, which creates variable vibrations in the tissue depending on the internal pressure. At the same time, a laser beam is aimed at the vibrating tissue. When the ultrasound wave and laser light interact, they produce changes in the diffraction pattern of the laser light. These changes are linked to variations in the speed of sound, which correspond to changes in pressure. By analyzing the angle and intensity of the diffracted laser light, precise measurements of pressure at different depths and locations within the tissue can be obtained.  This method is advantageous as it is non-invasive, eliminating the need for uncomfortable procedures such as measuring intraocular or intracranial pressure. With its potential applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and cardiology, this technology could significantly enhance patient care and medical diagnostics.","Accurate pressure measurement is crucial in medical diagnostics, yet current methods often involve invasive procedures or rely on indirect measurements, leading to discomfort and potential risks for patients. Methods like tonometry in ophthalmology and lumbar punctures in neurology require invasive contact and have associated risks. Existing non-invasive methods, like cuff-based sphygmomanometers in cardiology, lack continuous or internal pressure measurements within vessels.  This technology offers a non-invasive approach to measuring pressure in biological environments, such as the eye or brain tissue. By using the acousto-optic effect, it can precisely assess pressure at various depths and locations within the tissue. This innovation eliminates the discomfort and risks associated with current methods, providing safer, more accurate, and patient-friendly pressure measurements across different medical applications. Furthermore, the comfort and non-invasiveness of this technology would likely improve patient willingness to undergo these measurements, facilitating better disease management and monitoring.",Imaging & Optics
Efficient Colored Solar Panels and Cells with Integrated Coloration,"This technology is a novel method of integrating vibrant colors into solar panels and cells without significantly compromising their performance. This is achieved through innovative optical coatings and structures that create narrowband resonances, allowing for selective color reflection or transmission while maintaining high levels of light absorption for energy conversion. Fano Resonant Optical Coatings (FROCs) provide coloration to amorphous solar cells and solar thermal panels, and guided mode resonances provide coloration to crystalline solar cells. This technology has diverse applications in the solar panel industry as it can be used on crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and thermal solar panels. By making it possible to manufacture solar panels in a wide range of colors, this technology could enable the use of solar panels on buildings for which aesthetics are important design considerations. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) can now be seamlessly incorporated into architectural designs without detracting from the building's appearance. Similarly, consumer products powered by photovoltaics, such as portable chargers and wearables, can now enjoy a wider range of colors without sacrificing efficiency. Additionally, this technology could allow for portable solar powered devices to be available in many color options.","Solar panels may be overlooked as an option in buildings where aesthetics matter. Traditional solar panels are typically dark and uniform in color to maximize light absorption and energy conversion. However, the aesthetic limitations have restricted their use in various applications where appearance matters. Making them available in a variety of vibrant colors rather than the typical black or blue could allow for solar panels to more easily blend in with and complement a building’s design, which could lead to more widespread solar panel use. Solar panels in different colors are already available, but most are enabled by thin-film filters rather than the optical coatings used in this technology, and they currently tend to come with significant reductions in efficiency and at high prices.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

This design directs and mixes light efficiently, resulting in a high-performance LED package. The laser-driven white light source delivers high brightness, luminous flux, and high directionality for solid-state lighting applications. The technology is integrated into a standard Cassegrain optical model to develop a novel micro-LED device package that directs and mixes all lights of the system in order to optimize illumination and increase the output of the LED. The prototype LED design was optimized and found to significantly outperform existing commercial LEDs in terms of luminous efficacy, color fidelity, and projection efficiency.","Due to an increased emphasis on energy efficiency, LED researchers are actively seeking ways to increase the generation of white light per unit watt. The invention addresses the increasing demand for high-efficiency, high-brightness lighting solutions in solid-state lighting applications. Traditional LED systems often struggle with balancing high brightness, color accuracy, and energy efficiency. The proposed remote phosphor design using the reverse Cassegrain model offers a substantial improvement by optimizing light direction and mixing. This leads to higher luminous output and better color fidelity without sacrificing energy efficiency. This is important for electric vehicles looking to reduce their energy budget. Active studies are pointing towards utilizing lasers for headlamps as they are much brighter and cost about two-thirds the amount of energy when comparing to traditional sources.",Imaging & Optics

Heat Recovery System from High Temperature Slag from Metal Refinery Process,"This invention is a heat recovery system to obtain both the sensible and latent heat from the solidification and cooling process in refining copper. The invention will use a hot composition conveyor and a heat recovery apparatus to recover the heat from the metal refinery process. The heat recovery apparatus flushes the slag which will take the thermal energy away. Through radiation and convection, the heat is transferred before the disposal of the slag, which has great economic benefits due to the recovery of a large amount of waste heat effectively.","As a by-product of smelting or refining processes to purify metal-containing ores or crude metals, respectively, a large amount of high temperature molten slag is produced. The produced slag by-product is then separated from the desired metal product and generally allowed to cool naturally in an open environment or with the aid of water. During the cooling process, a considerable amount of energy is liberated from the slag by-product.

EZE-Gluc to Identify At-Risk Patients,"This technology is a functional test to assess which patients will have toxicity to drugs that use the same transporters as ezetimibe glucuronide, or EZE-Gluc. By administering ezetimibe, a commonly used drug, as a predictive diagnostic tool, healthcare providers can gauge the likelihood of treatment success for various medications. The key lies in measuring the levels of a specific metabolite, EZE-Gluc, in either urine or blood samples. This metabolite's behavior shifts in patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), affecting its elimination process. Normally eliminated through bile, in MASH patients, it tends to accumulate in plasma and urine instead. Understanding how EZE-Gluc behaves in MASH patients provides valuable insights into the functioning of crucial transport processes in the body. These processes not only impact the efficacy of ezetimibe but also influence the disposition of other drugs that share the same transport mechanisms. By conducting tests to assess EZE-Gluc levels before initiating treatment with drugs like pemetrexed, methotrexate, sorafenib, and others, healthcare providers can identify patients who might be at risk of adverse reactions or altered therapeutic outcomes.","The technology addresses the challenge of predicting the effectiveness and potential adverse reactions of various drugs, particularly in patients with conditions like Metabolic dysfunction-Associated SteatoHepatitis (MASH). Currently, healthcare providers rely on trial and error or general guidelines to determine the most suitable treatment for individual patients. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies, suboptimal outcomes, and even harmful side effects. Existing methods for assessing drug efficacy and toxicity typically involve monitoring symptoms, conducting laboratory tests, or adjusting dosages based on observed reactions. By using ezetimibe as a predictive diagnostic tool and measuring the levels of its metabolite, EZE-Gluc, healthcare providers gain valuable insights into the patient's ability to transport and eliminate certain drugs. This information allows for more targeted treatment plans, potentially reducing the risk of adverse reactions and improving therapeutic outcomes.

Elisa Test for EZE-Gluc (EZE-MASH),"This innovation is an ELISA assay test designed to help identify patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) by measuring levels of ezetimibe glucuronide, or EZE-Gluc, in urine. EZE-Gluc is a byproduct of the drug ezetimibe, which is processed differently in people with MASH, resulting in higher levels of EZE-Gluc in their urine. By administering a safe dose of ezetimibe and then measuring the EZE-Gluc levels, the device can indicate the presence of MASH. Elevated EZE-Gluc levels would not only suggest MASH but also indicate that certain other drugs might remain in the bloodstream longer, potentially requiring adjustments in their dosages. This makes the device a valuable tool for both diagnosing liver disease and managing medication for individuals with MASH.","Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) is a liver disease that complicates the body's ability to process certain medications, leading to higher risks of drug toxicity. Currently, diagnosing MASH typically requires invasive liver biopsies or complex imaging techniques, which can be costly, uncomfortable, and not easily accessible for all patients. These traditional methods are also not practical for frequent monitoring. This new device offers a non-invasive, at-home solution for detecting MASH by measuring the levels of EZE-Gluc, a metabolite of ezetimibe, in urine. Unlike current methods, this test is simple, safe, and can be performed without the need for medical professionals.

Fecal Containment Obstetric Drape,"This technology is an obstetric under-buttocks drape that has an additional flap located above the fluid collection portion for use during labor and delivery in childbirth. This is a one-size-fits all flap that has an adhesive lining at the top that allows for adhesion to the patient’s perineum and across the patient’s back thighs. The flap will not interfere with the delivery of the infant as it is located inferior to the vaginal introitus.

Time Resolved Fluorescence based HTS to Detect Structural Changes in cTnI,"This innovation involves the development of a probe that attaches to a specific protein called cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which is involved in muscle contraction of the heart. This probe, created through genetic engineering techniques, is designed to detect changes in cTnI's neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT). When there's a change in cTnT, it alters the environment around cTnI, which the probe can detect by changes in fluorescence. Essentially, the probe acts like a sensor that fluoresces when it detects certain changes in the heart muscle. The purpose of this innovation is to aid in the validation of potential drug candidates for treating a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). By using this probe, researchers can observe how different drugs affect the interaction between cTnI and cTnT. This information helps in understanding the effectiveness of drugs in treating HCM, a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle, and may lead to the development of improved treatment options for patients with this condition.","This technology is addressing the need for better methods to understand and treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, leading to potential complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Current solutions for studying HCM involve various methods, including genetic testing, imaging techniques like echocardiography, and medications to manage symptoms. However, these methods often fall short in providing a detailed understanding of the molecular changes underlying HCM and assessing the effectiveness of potential treatments. The innovation here lies in the development of a probe that specifically targets cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and detects changes in its neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), at a molecular level. This probe offers a more direct and precise method to monitor the interaction between these proteins, which is crucial in understanding the mechanisms of HCM and evaluating drug candidates. Unlike current methods, which may lack specificity or provide indirect measurements, this probe-based approach offers real-time, molecular-level insights into the dynamics of the heart muscle, potentially leading to more effective treatments for HCM. It provides a way to observe subtle changes in protein interactions that may not be easily detectable with conventional techniques, offering a promising avenue for both research and clinical applications in managing HCM.",Research Tools

Text Data Describing Examples of Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD),"This technology is a text data set of characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), consisting of “human-labeled” and “machine-labeled” data. The dataset consists of fragments of clinical text describing ASD typical behaviors in children. This data set will be used by algorithms for a number of applications. One application would be to serve as a training system for clinicians to better diagnose and recognize ASD in young children. Another application, for a more commercial audience, would be to use this algorithm in Alexa-like devices to allow parents to match behaviors of their children to receive a correct or appropriate diagnosis.","Currently, there are standardized algorithms used for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. However, this technology claims to have the largest set of examples in the text data set. The utilization of such a large data set could be imperative to progressing the accuracy of ASD testing and diagnosis in young children. The technology also has clinical and commercial applications, allowing technicians to train and better recognize signs of ASD in children at varying stages and with more specificity, while also allowing parents to monitor their children in their natural environments and readily compare their behaviors to a catalog of examples and clinical text to present to their clinician.",Software & Information Technology
Online Interface to Process Text and Identify Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in the Text,This software allows individuals to submit text and have segments of that text be highlighted and grouped based on if they are diagnostic criteria when testing for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Highlighting is performed based off different criterion and displayed in different colors. There is also a summary count of all criteria found and their frequencies provided via this software.,"The diagnosing process for autism is difficult since there is no medical test that pinpoints the disorder. In order to diagnose ASD doctors, clinicians need to look at a variety of characteristics within an individual, such as childhood developmental history and their behaviors. Along with symptom variation and doctor waitlists, diagnoses can be a tricky and a long process. 

This software will greatly assist with this through its ability to evaluate submitted text which in turn generates an output that highlights text that is relevant to ASD diagnosing characteristics. Each of these identified characteristics in the text is highlighted and segmented based on the different criterion for diagnosing these disorders. This will significantly reduce diagnoses times and will be easily implementable across many clinics due to its feasibility.",Software & Information Technology

A 2018 study by the CDC estimated that about 1 in 44 children in the US have ASD. Early detection is the best way to minimize developmental challenges among children with ASD. But many do not get diagnosed in a timely manner due to a lack of access to qualified diagnosticians as well as challenges with early diagnosis. Additionally, members of minority groups tend to be correctly diagnosed later and less often.

This technology serves to improve the state of ASD diagnosis, by speeding up the assessment process and empowering clinicians to make more informed decisions. Unlike many other diagnostic aids, it looks for behavior consistent with the diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the accepted authority on criteria to diagnose ASD conditions.",Software & Information Technology

A Dual-Luciferase Reporter System for Characterization of Small RNA Target Genes in both Mammalian and Insect Cells,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNA molecules that bind to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and affect the stability or translational efficiency of the bound mRNAs. Single or dual-luciferase reporter systems have been successfully used to identify miRNA target genes in mammalian cells, however, they are not sensitive enough to verify miRNA–target gene relationships in insect cell lines. The promoters for the target luciferase in insect cells are too weak to drive sufficient expression of the target luciferase in insect cells.","Small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are important for regulating gene expression. miRNAs regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, reproduction, death, metabolism, and development. miRNAs will interact with its target gene through base pairing, but it is very specific and there needs to be a minimum of eight similar base pairs. Currently, there is only one commercially available dual-luciferase (a photoprotein that is bioluminescent when bonded to its target) reporter system that can verify RNA genes. With only one dual-luciferase on the market there is a possibility of many miRNAs that are not being identified do the specificity required. Having the technology to alter and bind to these miRNAs can be useful for the pesticide industry for the development of a new pesticide.",Research Tools

This new telescope design solves these challenges with deployable and reconfigurable optical system, representing a breakthrough in the capabilities and significant step towards more inexpensive, effective space-based observatories.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Generalized BEP Relationships for the Prediction of Activation Energies via Machine Learning,"At the heart of computational catalyst design lies the construction of a suitable reaction network and the determination of reaction and activation energies for each step for a specific set of, for instance, metals. This technology aims to enable the creation of a sophisticated activation energy predictor / modeler that will enable the investigation and development of chemical reactions through an optimized catalyst.","Current methods require sophisticated teams working iteratively with best guesses to develop an optimized reaction. This technology aims to significantly improve the workflow for these teams by many magnitudes. Improving the number of options being analyzed and solving more problems and applications. While previously the identification of more efficient catalysts relied on the intuition of researchers in selecting and evaluating a small number of new compounds for a given reaction. However, today large search spaces can be screened using descriptor-based approaches obtained from computational work alone.

With the integration of machine learning, the reliance on human intuition diminishes, paving the way for more systematic and data-driven evaluations. This shift not only accelerates the research process but also eliminates potential human biases, ensuring that the most viable catalyst options are consistently brought to the forefront.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Method for On-Chip Squeezed and Entangled Light Generation,"Quantum entanglement is as follows: entangled photons for transferring information between two nodes, in which the receiver holds half of the entangled photons while the sender holds the other half. Thus, communication and sensing are made possible by manipulation of these photons and/or observation of the changes of these photons.","Quantum sensors emit photons that carry quantum information about surrounding magnetic and electric fields, which can be used for biosensing, neuroimaging, object detection, and other sensing applications. Traditional quantum sensors are large and use expensive components that limit practicality and scalability. This method proposed is another way to scale all the bulky components onto a chip which is millimeters in size. This is done using traditional semiconductor fabrication techniques. The ability to put a quantum sensor on a chip is a dramatic decrease in the size of the sensor and will allow for better integration into real world applications. This will also greatly decrease the cost it takes to produce quantum sensors because it builds off of traditional fabrication techniques.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Low Complexity Memory Decoding and Apparatus for LDPC Codes,"This technology presents a new class of finite precision multilevel decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These decoders are much lower in complexity compared to the standard belief propagation (BP) decoder. Messages utilized by these decoders are quantized to certain levels based on the number of bits allowed for representation in hardware. A message update function specifically defined as part of the invention, is used to determine the outgoing message at the variable node, and the simple min operation along with modulo 2 sum of signs is used at the check node. These decoders improve the iterative decoding process on finite length graphs and have the potential to outperform the standard floating-point BP decoder in the error floor region.","Error-correcting codes are indispensable for any modern digital communication system which requires reliable transmission and/or storage of digital data. A class of error-correcting codes called low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, that were originally discovered by Gallager in the 1960's and rediscovered some thirty years later, have sparked a widespread interest in the field of coding theory. The remarkable performance of LDPC codes as well as their simple and efficient high-speed implementations have made them very attractive for use in a plethora of applications ranging from wireless communication and deep-space communication systems to magnetic storage media.

In the past few years, a considerable amount of research has been dedicated towards constructing LDPC codes that have good distance properties, and finding better iterative decoders that enable simpler hardware implementations as well as have good asymptotic performance. Richardson et. al. in proposed the technique of density evolution under BP decoding in order to determine the asymptotic decoding threshold of a particular code and suggested using this analysis in order to optimize the code's profile for the best possible decoding threshold.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Zero-Added-Loss Entangled Photon Multiplexing Source,"This technology is a scheme for optical entanglement distribution in quantum networks based on a quasi-deterministic entangled photon pair source. By combining heralded photonic Bell pair generation with spectral mode conversion to interface with quantum memories, the scheme eliminates switching losses due to multiplexing.","Multiplexing allows higher single-photon probabilities and lower contamination from higher-order photon states. It can be achieved through using time, space, or frequency degrees of freedom to parallelize spontaneous photon creation across modes, then actively switch the photons into a single output mode based on feedback from heralding detection events. 

Although single photons are ideal for application purposes, often, more than one photon is produced by a source. Once produced, the state tends to encounter nonzero optical loss before reaching the application. This loss is a transformation that results in a state that contains both vacuum and multiphoton components along with the desired single photon.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Recovery and Separation of Metals from Aqueous Sources Utilizing Glycolipid Modified Hydrogels and Resins,"This invention describes a methodology for using glycolipid-modified, reusable hydrogels to recover, concentrate, and separate toxic metals from aqueous solutions.","Heavy and toxic metal contamination poses a significant risk to human and environmental health in many commercial and environmental settings. Many commercial endeavors in fields such as mining have both a regulatory and business obligation to control toxic metal contamination and reduce exposure to personnel.

The inventors have proposed a methodology and formulations for glycolipid-modified, reusable hydrogels and glycolipid-functionalized resins to absorb toxic metal contamination from aqueous solutions.

This innovation overcomes geographical barriers, enhances access to critical medical interventions, reduces the burden on patients associated with travel and waiting times, and potentially lowers healthcare costs.","Wound debridement is the process of removing dead or unhealthy tissue from a wound in order to promote healing. This is especially common for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Currently, patients are required to physically travel to medical centers for wound debridement, leading to increased costs, time constraints, and potential delays in receiving necessary care. The proposed technology would enable healthcare professionals to remotely perform wound debridement, increasing healthcare access to underserved regions.",Life Sciences
Level I: MENTOR Institute Online Training,"This is a professional development training developed by the MENTOR (Mentorship through Effective Networking, Transformational Opportunities, and Research) Institute at the University of Arizona. The purpose is to enhance mentoring practices as a means to improve outcomes such as career advancement, obtaining a great job, timely promotion, academic milestones, and graduation. This training, which was created based on expert consultation with experienced faculty and graduate students across UArizona, integrates best practices from well-established national organizations and was reviewed for inclusivity and accessibility of content by UArizona’s Disability Resource Center. This training has been designed for all faculty, postdocs, and graduate students and is focused on training both mentors and mentees. It can be completed asynchronously in roughly 60-75 minutes either online or via a Learning Management System.","Mentoring relationships of all kinds — peer mentors, mentoring communities, and one-on-one partnerships — can be extremely beneficial as mentors and mentees work to build their mentor universe but are arguably different from other workplace relationships. Mentoring program participants must understand the objectives of the program, their roles, expectations, and best practices prior to entering into the relationship. Programs that start without mentoring training and instructions usually receive negative feedback such as participants feeling unprepared and indeterminate. This leads to a poor mentoring experience and, eventually, the program fails. This facilitates the need for effective and practical mentor/ mentee training programs, especially one that can be made for each party in a mentor/mentee relationship.",Creative Works
More Green Dots,"More Green Dots is a social-ecological approach to increasing intervention into prosocial interactions, or kindness, using an activity with green and red dots to track kind and unkind behaviors. For kind behaviors, the giver, receiver, and anyone who witnesses the kindness earns a green dot. Red dots are larger than green dots to indicate the negativity bias that causes people to place more weight on negative experiences. At the end of the activity, green and red dots are totaled up to see the “sum” of a person’s experience. It is imperative that a sense of security and belonging exists in order to successfully promote health and wellness at the individual and community level. This approach looks to implement kindness learning as practice, whilst receiving support for digital tracking methods to increase retention.","Research shows that individual and community health and well-being depends on members feeling a sense of security, belonging, and trust in their community. This connectedness is communicated through kind interpersonal behaviors, organizational policies and systems, and even built environments. Kindness interventions tend to focus on the individual and the routine integration of kindness learning and practice at the organizational and community levels is lacking. Because kindness is interactional and is communicated between people and groups, a social-ecological approach to intervention is needed.

The relationship between prosocial acts and health have been evaluated through multiple studies over the last few decades. One analysis of 12 studies with a focus on acts of kindness, found that acts of kindness were associated with improved health outcomes. Relying on this finding, multiple methods to analyze the intervention to determine effectiveness of these methods. This new method involves the use of researched pre-evaluation services coupled with digital tracking to foster intervention from afar.",Software & Information Technology
Identification of Inhibitors of Trogocytosis to Treat Cancer,This innovation is the identification and isolation of small molecules to inhibit trogocytosis to prevent or slow cancer cell tumor growth. Researchers plan to develop cell lines transduced with lentivirus vectors that can be cocultured and the process of trogocytosis will result in cell fusion that will generate a luminescent signal. Selected small molecules with demonstrated inhibition will undergo further studies to validate their functional properties and optimize their structure. The ultimate objective is to develop a drug that can be administered directly into the tumor site through injection or other systemic means to effectively hinder tumor development.,"Trogocytosis occurs when a very early-stage epithelial cell interacts with an endogenous lymphocyte in a transient manner such that membranes and protein molecules are exchanged. Later, they become stable fused cells in which the proteins are expressed in a stable form. Trogocytosis has been identified as a key factor in the formation of solid tumors, particularly renal clear cell tumors.

The technology improves upon existing approaches by providing a targeted and efficient screening method for identifying molecules that can inhibit trogocytosis. This approach may lead to the development of a drug that can effectively hinder tumor development. The improved screening method could also potentially reduce costs and accelerate the drug development process by identifying promising candidates more efficiently.",Healthcare Portfolios
Transplantable Murine Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines,"This innovation involves the creation of novel cell lines for studying cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in mice. These cell lines, derived from UV-induced cSCC tumors in BALB/c mice, recapitulate the mutational signature and driver mutations found in human cSCC. Developing the cell lines from an inbred mouse strain allows for studies involving antigen-specific T cell responses, as the major histocompatibility complex alleles are the same between mice. Additionally, the ability to intradermally transplant the cSCC tumors into mice drastically reduces the length of time needed for experimentation, as UV induction of cSCC takes months. This innovation provides researchers with invaluable tools for studying cSCC and exploring potential treatments and drug development.","There is a lack of clinically relevant UV-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) murine models that can be used to study antigen-specific T cell responses. Other cSCC mouse models require long periods of time to create, cannot be used to evaluate certain T cell responses, and/or may not recapitulate the mutational signature and burden of human disease. This mouse model stands out as it is induced by the same etiologic factor as human disease, shares driver mutations with human disease, has a high mutational burden, allows for neoantigen evaluation, and reliably forms tumors in vivo compared to other mouse models.",Research Tools
PNA5 Treatment in Myocardial Ischemic Reperfusion Injury Decreases Infarction Size and Promotes Heart Function,"This innovation is a novel method of treating cardiovascular disease, specifically, the continued tissue damage that occurs during myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury (MIRI) elicited by myocardial ischemia. While damage during MIRI is multifaceted, this new treatment addresses nearly every caveat including reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium overload, and multiple inflammatory responses. Studies completed by the innovators have shown that the PNA5 treatment reduced infarct size by 35.02% compared to the control-treated animals, decreased regional fibrosis compared to control-treated mice, and preserved heart function.","While reperfusion therapies are required to address myocardial ischemia successfully, the continued tissue damage that occurs during myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury (MIRI) can negatively impact the recovery of the heart’s structure and function. The treatment of choice for reducing acute myocardial ischemic injury and limiting MI size is timely and effective myocardial reperfusion using either thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). However, the process of reperfusion can itself induce cardiomyocyte death, known as myocardial reperfusion injury, for which there is still no effective therapy.",Life Sciences
Methods of Treating Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure,"This innovation is the repurposing of drugs used for testosterone-suppression (androgen deprivation) as an innovative strategy to treat heart failure or dilated cardiomyopathy. These drugs are used for treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer or for adolescents presenting with precocious puberty. This research is supported by published data demonstrating that surgical suppression of testosterone delays cardiac dysfunction and the progression to symptomatic heart failure (HF), which is defined by edema/congestion. In addition, surgical suppression of testosterone prolongs survival in male mice with progressive dilated cardiomyopathy.","Despite advances in evidence-based pharmacological therapies, patients with heart failure (HF) continue to exhibit significant morbidity and excess mortality at rates of up to 30% at one year. This high event rate coupled with ongoing symptoms of fatigue, cardiac cachexia, and a metabolic shift toward catabolism has led to an intense search for therapies to further improve HF symptoms. Nearly one in three people in the U.S. will develop heart failure, characterized by fluid retention (edema) in the lungs and elsewhere. This leads to difficult breathing, deterioration of physical capacity, restriction of normal activities, and death.",Healthcare Portfolios
Scattering Based Light Sheet Microscope,"This invention relates to designs of a low-cost scattering-based light sheet microscope that provides microscopic images of human tissue in vivo. The key idea is to use an incoherent line light source with a rectangular aperture to generate light sheet illumination and detect the scattered light from the illuminated tissue plane to generate images. The use of line illumination and rectangular aperture provides a small illumination light sheet width over a large field of view, while reducing the speckle noise and shadow artifacts.","Light sheet microscopy (LSM) is a relatively new microscopy technology used in basic life science research. LSM uses separate optical paths for illumination and detection, where the illumination optics determine the axial resolution, and the detection optics determine the lateral resolution. This invention can be used to develop low-cost, small form-factor light sheet microscopy devices for diagnosing diseases of human internal organs in vivo and freshly excised specimens ex vivo, including anus, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon. The microscope device can be used in a wide range of clinical settings (including primary-care clinics, surgical suites, and under-resourced remote hospitals without pathology services), as well as for training and educational purposes.

Furthermore, the advancements in LSM technology, combined with the unique features of this invention, present a transformative opportunity. The potential to deliver high-resolution imaging at a fraction of the cost of current technologies can significantly improve early disease detection and provide essential insights into cellular dynamics and structures.",Imaging & Optics
CPS1 Markerless Deletion Mutant as a Method for Marker Deletion,"This technology involves a novel system using a two-step process to eliminate a gene of interest by incorporating a “suicide gene” vector system. The construct created by this method results with no foreign sequences, making the strains markerless mutants. This means that one has the potential to make genetic strains with multiple mutations and can therefore contribute to nearly every area of biological research.","Ultimately, one wishes to determine how genes—and the proteins they encode—function in the intact organism. Although it may sound counterintuitive, one of the most direct ways to find out what a gene does is to see what happens to the organism when that gene is missing. Studying mutant organisms that have acquired changes or deletions in their nucleotide sequences is a time-honored practice in biology. Because mutations can interrupt cellular processes, mutants often hold the key to understanding gene function. In the classical approach to the important field of genetics, one begins by isolating mutants that have an interesting or unusual appearance: fruit flies with white eyes or curly wings, for example. While methods of producing these mutations have become more sophisticated as time has progressed, the need to modernize biological techniques has never been greater.",Life Sciences
Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of Cortical Arousal During Sleep,"This invention is an end-to-end deep learning algorithm to detect cortical arousals during sleep using a one-night single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. It is used to accurately detect arousal in home sleep tests, by reducing the false negative rate. The model combines both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN).","Sleep apnea is a side effect caused by excess weight and obesity, affecting more than a billion people worldwide. Sleep apnea is a ubiquitous sleep-related respiratory disease. Long term occurrences may lead to serious cardiovascular and neurological disease. Diagnosing and monitoring sleep apnea can happen in a lab or hospital with devices on the patient or at home. Home sleep testing is the preferred method for evaluation. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a highly recommended therapy for sleep apnea patients. It involves a machine that uses mild air pressure to keep airways open, helping an apneic person get sound sleep. However, despite its popularity, CPAP has disadvantages that are likely to negatively affect the sleep apnea treatment devices market growth. For example, CPAP machines are infamous for causing discomfort as patients find it difficult to sleep in specific positions to not to displace the mask on their face. Also, recording electroencephalogram (EEG) data is very inconvenient at home. There is a need for an improved method to detect cortical arousal to assist in the monitoring and diagnosis of sleep apnea with less noise and less intervention to home sleep testing patients.",Healthcare Portfolios

Simulated Equine Radiographic System with Radiographic Images,This is an educational tool called a Simulated Equine Radiographic Machine (SERM) that helps veterinary students learn how to conduct examination procedures on horses. Students use a device with a display to “scan” a real or dummy horse and practice radiometry procedures.,"Current technology to help students learn how to do these procedures is nonexistent. Students must go to a clinic with a horse under examination and utilize expensive radiographic equipment and PPE (gowns, gloves, thyroid shields) protection, making it a very expensive and cumbersome process. This invention would lower costs and make the training safer by eliminating exposure to radiation.
This new technology solves the problem by letting students practice without the need of a clinic or any of the equipment. The model allows learners to handle imaging equipment safely and without radiation exposure as they develop proficiency positioning radiographic plates and placing directional markers. Learners can also test their understanding of radiographic positioning in reverse: if given a radiograph, they can be asked to describe how the x-ray generator was positioned to obtain the diagnostic image, The student can use a real horse or a model, orient the simulated radiographic machine, a second student orients the simulated plate.  Then “scan” the area of interest with a mobile system.",Veterinary Medicine

Phase Modulated Camera,"This invention provides a method to image though a disruptive media, such as fog, rain, snow, and sand particles. The phase-based camera, coupled with existing cameras and sensors normally equipped on autonomous vehicles, allows for detection and viewing objects through fog, smoke, or other atmospheric obstructions. The system consists of a lens, phase light modulation (PLM) device, 2-dimension detector array such as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imager and a light source, such as a collimated laser, which illuminates the object. Return signal from an object—for example, a car in fog—is captured by camera with a PLM which is situated in the optical path between the camera lens and 2-dimentional detector array. In the system, two or more images are captured by camera while displaying phase and/or amplitude profiles which are orthogonal with each other. The images are subtracted to eliminate background and deconvolved to enhance the feature inside the fog or other disruptive media.","Camera-based object recognition and autonomous driving based on the information is one of the critical functions for Advanced Driver Assistant System (ADAS) for automotives. Camera-based ADAS is not only applicable for ground-based mobility, but also for mobility in air. Recently, Amazon announced “Amazon Prime Air,” which are FAA-approved delivery drones that carry packages while the drones are autonomously navigated by camera. All such mobility infrastructures rely upon situational awareness by camera, and other means such as radar and LIDAR. One of the common challenges in situation awareness for urban mobility as an infrastructure is robustness to inclement weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow. The camera-based situation awareness does not work well in such conditions. In contrast, the radar can see through fog since the wavelength is much longer compared to the length scale of fog and rainwater particles. However, known challenges include resolution and signal contrast. This technology offers radar-like capability with the resolution of an optical camera.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

PD-L1 is a molecule involved in immune regulation and can be upregulated in response to UV radiation and environmental toxins. However, overexpression of PD-L1 can lead to immune evasion by cancer cells and contribute to skin damage. By blocking PD-L1, the immune system’s response can be enhanced, leading to better recognition and elimination of cancer cells and minimizing skin damage. This approach holds potential for the development of therapies or interventions to protect against skin cancer and mitigate the adverse effects of UV exposure and environmental toxins on the skin.","Current approaches to treat the negative impact of solar UV exposure and environmental toxicants that contribute to skin damage, skin cancer, and premature aging primarily rely on sun protection measures and existing skin cancer treatments, but they have limitations such as incomplete protection and associated side effects.

In addition to its environmental impacts, nitric oxide also serves as an important biomarker of respiratory health associated with asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Furthermore, nitric oxide is easily oxidized in air to nitrogen dioxide, which is highly corrosive, toxic, and a danger to human respiratory health. To mitigate injury due to gas exposure and monitor the environmental impacts of industrial processes, selective sensors for nitric oxide detection must be developed and deployed.

Current solutions for nitric oxide detection typically rely on various methods, including chemiluminescence, electrochemical sensors, and optical sensors such as cavity ring-down spectroscopy. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the level of sensitivity and selectivity needed for accurately measuring trace concentrations of nitric oxide in complex environments. This technology is capable of real-time, reversible and irreversible sensing over a wide concentration range while maintaining resistance to humidity, making it a versatile and highly effective tool for nitric oxide detection, surpassing the limitations of traditional detection methods.",Imaging & Optics

High-Throughput 3D Printing System,"This invention is a high-throughput 3D printing system that employs a multi-head configuration, complemented by custom objectives designed for an expanded field of view (FOV). This approach uses a custom-designed microscope objective with expanded FOV for greater accuracy during production. The system results in a significant increase in 3D printing throughput, enabling greater production efficiency and speed, and improving the current state of 3D nano-printing technology (two-photon polymerization, or TPP).","The current two-photon polymerization (TPP) printing method has a notable drawback: its relatively low throughput, primarily due to the microscope objective's limited FOV, which is typically less than 1mm. While stitching methods have been employed to print larger elements, they are not ideal for optical elements because optical surfaces demand exceptional quality, and even minute variations at the transition regions between stitched areas can significantly degrade image quality. Furthermore, the restricted FOV of the objective lens hinders the potential of printing more than one element or system with the dimensions suitable for micro-optics using cutting-edge techniques.​​​​​​​",Engineering & Physical Sciences
HCV3 for Multiple Indications involving Alpha2B Receptor Modulation,"The invention is a preclinical drug candidate (HCV3) based on the discovery that substituted 1-arylalkyl-4-acylaminopiperide compounds have shown to be effective antagonists of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors and/or alpha-2-adrenoreceptors.  HCV3 can be used to treat clinical conditions that are due to activation of any one or more of the receptors, including hemorrhagic shock, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, gastrointestinal side effects of opioids, cancer therapy, epithelial wounds, herpes zoster infection, opioid-induced pruritus, as well as other clinical conditions.","Currently, traditional narcotic analgesics are employed to manage pain and induce anesthesia, but they come with the drawback of potential overdose complications and the risk of patient intolerance.

AI-Based Synthetic Generation of Radio-Frequency Maps in Wireless Communication Systems,"This technology is a novel, cost-effective method which creates radiofrequency (RF) maps used in wireless communication. The improvement is that this technology can use previous RF maps as inputs and with the help of sophisticated artificial intelligence, produce new areas or new capabilities with the requirement of significant field measurements. This inventive method presents a valuable solution for efficiently generating RF maps and overcoming the complexities associated with site surveys, ray tracing, and other existing techniques. This technology can be used in any type of synthesizing heat maps, such as, weather heat maps, heat maps in biological imaging, etc., as well as for enhanced network planning, interference coordination, resource allocation, and localization.","Collecting RF data and conducting site surveys to construct RF maps is both time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the complex and dynamic nature of the wireless environment and the many of factors that can affect signal propagation, including building material, terrain, and interference. The technology is expected to achieve half the error rate of existing technologies.  The process of constructing RF maps becomes even more complex at high frequencies (e.g., millimeter-wave band), as many configurations must be investigated. Alternative state-of-the-art techniques for RF map generation rely on ray-tracing approaches. Besides their high computational complexity, ray-tracing approaches mainly require precise description of the objects in the RF environment along with their electromagnetic properties.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Hadamard Transform-Charge Detection-Mass Spectrometry,"This technology uses a multiplexing approach to online size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with Orbitrap CD-MS. A microcontroller is used to deliver pulsed injections from a large sample loop onto a SEC for online CD-MS analysis. The method produces a series of peaks spaced according to the pseudo-random injection sequence, which are demultiplexed with a Hadamard transform algorithm. This improves CD-MS signals while preserving the retention time information. This multiplexing approach provides a general solution to the inherent incompatibilities of online separations and CD-MS detection that will enable a range of applications.","Charge detection mass spectrometry (CD-MS) is a powerful technique for the analysis of large, heterogeneous biomolecules. By directly measuring the charge states of individual ions, CD-MS can produce accurate mass measurements from spectra where conventional deconvolution approaches fail due to the lack of isotopic resolution or distinguishable charge states. CD-MS has found applications in the characterization of very large (up to tens of mega-Daltons (MDa)) biomolecules such as protein complexes, intact virus capsids, vaccines, and gene therapies. Growing needs in biotechnology and the introduction of commercial instruments has led to increased interest in analyzing large, heterogeneous biomolecules. CD-MS is limited in that only a small number of ions can be measured at a time, which necessitates the acquisition of many hundreds or thousands of spectra to provide enough detection events for accurate mass measurements with acceptable signal to noise ratios. These long acquisitions generally prevent the coupling of CD-MS with online (i.e., real-time) separation techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), which typically only provide enough time for 50-200 scans during the elution of a chromatographic peak. Progress has been made on this front by refining CD-MS instrumentation to enable the measurement of multiple ions simultaneously and improve charge state assignments with deconvolution algorithms. However, a recent effort to evaluate the feasibility of online SEC-CD-MS produced deconvolved mass spectra that, while sufficient to measure accurate protein masses, had lower signal-to-noise ratios and contained significantly more erroneous peaks than spectra produced from infusion experiments. Accordingly, there remains a need to develop methods, and apparatuses containing a device, for improved acquisition of analytical data for very large, heterogeneous biomolecules and/or microorganisms.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Herbostroiodine exhibits dual-action by chelating and removing radioactive elements like I-131 and Sr90 from the body while mitigating their adverse effects. It surpasses conventional radioprotective drugs, such as potassium-iodine, in effectiveness and safety, with minimal side effects. Inspired by the resilience of cockroaches and bdelloid rotifers to radiation, this herbal drug offers a novel approach to radiation protection and has potential applications in anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant therapies.","The development of Herbostroiodine stems from the need for a more effective and safer radioprotective drug in the face of radioactive elements like I-131 and Sr90, which pose significant health risks. Traditional remedies often have limited efficacy and undesirable side effects. The innovation lies in its unique formulation using noisomes, enabling the simultaneous delivery of hydrophobic and hydrophilic agents for enhanced oral bioavailability.

"Compact, Lightweight Counter for Atmospheric Cloud Condensation Nuclei and Condensation Nuclei","This technology details a lightweight integrated analysis instrument for dual use to directly sample, analyze, and count atmospheric cloud condensation nuclei and/or condensation nuclei. The instrument can be operated in dual modes:  as a Cloud Condensation Nucleus Counter (CCNC) and as a Condensation Nucleus Counter (CNC). An integrated prototype fits in a portable, lightweight bag, and directly draws in atmospheric samples into an analysis chamber to count either cloud condensation nuclei or condensation nuclei, depending on this setting is selected. Measurements are then displayed and recorded in real time.","The United Nations Committee on Climate Change has repeatedly said that clouds and aerosols are the biggest unknowns in the Greenhouse Warming estimates. Due to the potential low cost, this technology might enable the operation of thousands of aerosols monitoring stations rather than perhaps the few hundred that are currently available. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs) are atmospheric particles that absorb water in the presence of supersaturated water vapor and grow, or activate, to form cloud droplets or an ice particle. The CCN can be the size of about 0.1 micron up to 1 mm, or about 1/100 the size of a cloud droplet.
 
In addition to atmospheric clouds and aerosols, the invention can measure condensation nuclei (CNs), which are tiny aerosol particles (which may range in size from 1 Angstrom up to 0.1 micron). CNCs may be useful in the areas of indoor air monitoring, cleanrooms, and personal health monitoring.",Sensors & Controls
Solid Set Flood Irrigation,"This invention is a solid-set irrigation bubbler head sprinkler system designed to replace existing low-output sprinkler heads commonly used in agricultural fields. The design of the system directs the water downward to guide it toward the soil while simultaneously controlling the flow to prevent soil erosion. This innovation allows for more precise flooding of fields and precise fertilizer applications. The solution devised by the team at Yuma County Cooperative Extension promises to significantly improve the efficiency of flood irrigation for secondary crops, leading to more sustainable and productive agricultural practices in Arizona and beyond.","Historically, secondary crops have relied on “basin flood irrigation,” a low-cost method that flattens the land and opens a single canal gate to flood the field gradually. This is crucial not only for providing the necessary water and nutrients to the crops but also for dissolving and washing away accumulated salt. However, the challenge with traditional flood irrigation has been uneven water distribution across the field, with more water infiltrating near the canal gate and less at the opposite end. This leads to suboptimal crop growth, as well as salt accumulation in some areas, which can be detrimental to crop health. By replacing low-output sprinkler heads, this innovation enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of flood irrigation, promoting healthier crop growth and reducing the environmental impact associated with excessive water and fertilizer use.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Smart EVD System,"This invention is a smart system for the collection of cerebrospinal fluid from an external ventricular drain (EVD) that can automatically adjust the height and intercranial pressure of a patient. The invention will use a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow sensor, a way to determine the position of the patient and the collection vessel, and an actuator that can automatically adjust the position of the collection vessel to compensate for any motion of the patient to help maintain the patient’s intercranial pressure. This can also determine the actual flow of CSF and adjust the height of the collection vessel so that over-drainage does not occur.","External ventricular drain (EVD) systems are used to treat brain trauma, stroke, inflammation, and other conditions associated with the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the brain. A typical EVD system contains a catheter inserted in the brain ventricle, tubing with a 3-way sampling port, a check valve preventing back-flow, and a collection vessel placed at a pre-determined height to ensure a constant value of intracranial pressure. One of the drawbacks of such systems is that frequent monitoring of the equipment is needed to ensure that the vessel is in a correct position.

Another issue of current EVD systems is related to the intercranial pressure. The pressure configuration of an EVD system is patient and disease specific, so it is critical to have a good value for each case. A high pressure might be less effective in treating the patient’s condition, while a low pressure could result in over-draining, with a risk of collapse of ventricles and associated irreversible damage.",Healthcare Portfolios
Incoherent Addition to Generalize Depolarization in Light Scattering Models,"Models for polarized light scattering are relevant for creating virtual reality scenes. To get a “real” looking model, the light scattering on the model needs to be simulated correctly to get a realistic model. The polarimetry of objects is measured in the lab, fit to a model, and this model is used to simulate the polarized light scattering of objects in computer simulations. This new model can generalize two unpolarized, partially polarized, or fully polarized scattering through 4 fully polarized terms. Since these terms are fully polarized, the technology does not require least-squares fitting.","The growth of virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality is becoming increasingly used in video games and as training tools. This increase in use is driving the need for innovations that make these technologies cheaper, faster, and more robust.
Models for polarized light scattering are of interest to computer vision, atmospheric sciences, stray light analysis, and medicine. The robustness of current polarized light scattering models is insufficient for generalization to a diverse set of materials. Even relatively simple variations in surface texture defy the constraints of a single model.",Imaging & Optics
Reflective Objective Microscope,"The invention is an all-reflective microscope with the unique characteristic that has an off-axis configuration with freeform surfaces. This configuration was not possible in the past due to the limitations in the design, fabrication, and testing of freeform optics.

It marks a significant step forward in leveraging the full potential of freeform surfaces.","Freeform optics are surfaces that lack an axis of rotational invariance. Freeform surfaces may appear to have arbitrary shape, and regular or irregular surface structures. They have a broad area of application such as aerospace illumination and biomedical imaging. 

In the area of imaging systems, freeform surfaces are designed to improve optical performance by removing optical aberrations, increasing the depth of field, and expanding the field of view.

Furthermore, the innovative approach of combining classical and quantum methods presents new possibilities for tackling complex computational problems in graph theory.","This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm solves the well-known NP-complete problem of determining if two given graphs are a vertex minor of one another. The inventors found a way to map a graph into GBS that allows trading between the one-shot classification accuracy and the amount of squeezing needed at the input, a hard-to-produce quantum-optical resource. This mapping to GBS not only optimizes the computational resources but also opens doors for new research avenues in quantum computing and graph theory.

Classification of vertex-minor graphs has been primarily tackled using traditional classical algorithms, which often prove inefficient and time-consuming for large and complex graph structures. The existing methodologies lack the flexibility to adapt to the various challenges of graph theory, leading to limitations in both research and practical applications.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Dual-View Microscope,A new type of microscope objective that integrates simultaneous co-axis low-resolution wide field of view (FOV) imaging with high-resolution small field of view imaging. A waveguide is used to relay the pupil of the wide field of view imaging system to the axis of the objective. The system addresses limitations of state-of-the-art microscope objectives and is particularly useful for biomedical and cancer imaging.,"Optical microscopy is a key tool in biomedical and cancer imaging because it offers several ideal features for imaging cells and tissue structure. For example, (1) the resolution is well-matched to the sizes of subcellular structures, (2) a diverse range of available fluorescent probes makes it possible to mark proteins, organelles, and other structures for imaging, (3) the relatively nonperturbing nature of light means that living cells can be imaged for long periods of time to follow their dynamics, (4) it offers a wide spectral range that enables various imaging modalities to investigate cellular processes and/or structural, molecular, and chemical characteristics, (5) and it is an essential tool in clinical cancer imaging. 

For clinical and research microscopy, the objective is the most important component since it determines the resolution and throughput. While there are significant efforts in developing new objectives for various applications, the state-of-the-art microscope objectives still have some major limitations. One limitation of the current state-of-the-art microscope objectives is that they are designed without consideration of integrating low-resolution, wide-FOV imaging capability. Since the FOV is small, it is difficult to locate regions of interest (ROI) for imaging. There are some efforts in solving this and other limitations by developing special objective with dual-FOV or adding a compact wide-FOV imaging modality to the central region of the objective. To address these limitations of current objectives, the innovation introduces integrated wide-FOV imaging.",Imaging & Optics
Joint Space Quantification of Multiple Carpal Bones of Wrist-based on 3D Imaging,"This technology is a software that is able to calculate the distance between joints among the carpal bones using 3D imaging, such as CT scan or MRI.

The unique combination enhances signal clarity, reducing background noise and increasing overall sensitivity. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize methods and protocols in research fields requiring precise radioisotope detection.","Radioisotopes are used in clinical diagnosis, therapy of various medical conditions, environmental analyses, nuclear systems, and research in both the physical and life sciences. This involves the investigation of low-energy radiation emitting atoms in chemical solutions. To investigate these, however, requires techniques of detection that are currently cumbersome or unreliable.

"Peptides to Treat SARS-CoV, Pulmonary Hypertension and other Pulmonary Vascular Diseases","This innovation is centered around a peptide designed to interrupt the action of a protein called Aminopeptidase N (APN). This peptide functions as an antagonist or inhibitor, binding to the intracellular portion of APN. The primary focus of this technology is to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and viral infections, including COVID-19. PAH is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by thickening of the pulmonary arteries due to uncontrolled proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure. The technology aims to target the causal protein, APN, which plays a major role in the pathological mechanisms of PAH triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction (MD). The research team has identified a specific domain of APN in the cytosolic region that has significant pathological implications. Initial results in preclinical studies with the APN blocking peptide have shown promising outcomes, effectively controlling APN signaling without affecting its essential peptidase domain, thus offering a novel and efficient strategy for treating PAH.","Current treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression, but they often have limited efficacy and manage symptoms without addressing the underlying pathological mechanisms. There is a critical need for a targeted therapy that can intervene at the early stages of this deadly cardiovascular disease to reverse vascular remodeling and mitigate disease progression. In contrast, this novel peptide technology specifically targets a protein implicated in the pathology of PAH, particularly in cases induced by mitochondrial dysfunction (MD).

A Method of Treating Fibrosis and Cancer across Organ Systems,"This technology is directed to a method of treating fibrosis and cancer by targeting circulating cells. Researchers identified mechanoresponsive myeloid subpopulations present in fibrotic and healthy tissue. Certain subpopulations of circulating cells have been implicated in the processes of cancer and fibrosis. These subpopulations are subsequently modulated by manipulating mechanical strain <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro </em>and find that specifically targeting a certain type of signaling is sufficient to reduce the pro-fibrotic subpopulations and instead restore the native, anti-inflammatory subpopulations.","Injury in all organs comprises of a coordinated process involving resident cells of the injury area as well as cells recruited from the circulation. Many recent studies have examined the importance of tissue resident fibroblast heterogeneity and mechanical signaling in healing and fibrosis. However, tissue repair also involves blood cells, part of the inflammatory response, that are recruited from the circulation. While the vast majority of circulating cells are immune cells, a rare population of cells have been identified in mammalian blood samples over two decades ago.

To alleviate the trade-off between FOV and resolution, a foveated display, inspired by the foveation properties of the human eye, can be generally defined as a method that identifies a user's region of interest (ROI) and allocates limited resources, such as a finite number of pixels or data processing and transmission bandwidth, differently between the ROI and the peripheral area outside the ROI region.",Imaging & Optics
Lensfree Microscopy for Ultrafine Particulate Matter Monitoring,"This system monitors ultrafine particulate matter and pollution in the air using compact, inexpensive, and portable devices, which enable time-resolved measurements particle sizes. It could be used to implement a dense network of devices, which provide ultra-precise real-time monitoring of air content and quality levels.","Particulate matter 100 nm and smaller is “ultrafine” particulate matter, which is particularly hazardous to human health despite not being widely monitored like “fine” particulate matter, which is less than 2.5 um in size. Lensfree microscopes have advantages over conventional microscopes due to their cost-effective hardware, compact and light-weight form factor, and high-space bandwidth product, which is the field of view divided by the area of the smallest resolvable spot. A high space-bandwidth product allows many objects to be imaged simultaneously within a large field of view (FOV).","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Concentrated Solar Receiver and Reaction Chambers for Hydrogen Production using Solar Energy,This technology is a solar receiver tower that has a set of reciprocally rotatable chambers that receive different amounts of solar energy at the tower. This differentiates the temperatures of each chamber to house different stages of thermochemical reactions for hydrogen production. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen for fuel is a solution for long-term solar energy storage.,"The problem with current technologies for producing hydrogen fuel is that they are not sustainable, efficient, or cost-effective. Traditional hydrogen production methods, such as steam reforming and partial oxidation, rely on fossil fuels, which are finite and produce greenhouse gases during the production process. Other methods, such as electrolysis, are energy-intensive and require large amounts of electricity, making them costly and inefficient.

This technology addresses these issues by using solar energy to produce hydrogen. By utilizing the different temperatures of each chamber in the tower, the technology is able to produce hydrogen more efficiently and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the use of solar energy makes the process sustainable and reduces the production of greenhouse gases.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Force Sensing System for Surgical Self-Retaining Retractors,This invention is a single self-retaining retractor with an autoclave force sensor mounted on each side of the retractor at the tissue interface. A force sensor is connected to a processing circuit via autoclave wires and a thermocouple. The processing circuit is connected via a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) with a mobile application to display store and share the data that has been collected. The app also alerts the user if the programmed force threshold has been exceeded. The sensor subassembly portion is sterilizable via autoclave.,"In the operating room, surgeons employ self-retaining retractors to enhance visibility of the surgical site, eliminating the requirement for an assistant to manually retract the soft tissue. However, a potential complication arises from the excessive pressure exerted by these retractors on the soft tissue, which can result in nerve palsies. Nerve palsies can lead to patient discomfort and functional impairments. There is a need to address this issue as 10-40% of patients experience chronic neuropathic pain form surgery-induced neuropathic pain.",Healthcare Portfolios
Wide Area Spectralelectrochemical Measurement of Thin Film Semiconductors for Electronic Band Structure Analysis,"This invention is a rapid, nondestructive detection method for properties of semiconductor stacks (including perovskite stacks for use in photovoltaics) which can be used at speeds and scales relevant for manufacturing to check product quality. This invention could reduce/remove barriers for manufacturing scale-up and production of high quality robust next generation photovoltaics.","The physical properties and chemical characteristics of perovskite thin films and their contact interfaces are complex and defects arising in these materials may be stochastic. Very sophisticated measurement and analysis techniques to determine the quality of these materials and composites may not be suitable or practical for manufacturability. Therefore, there is a need for effective measurement techniques which can support scaled-up manufacturing. A new technology presented here is a spectro-electrochemical measurement of energy levels. This measurement technique can be applied for a wide area and at speeds relevant for manufacturing and results in determining characteristic of multilayer stacks, including the portions of material ""buried"" in the stack, such as interfaces. This technique is a broad concept that may be suitable for application to other multi-layer semiconductor stacks comprising many semiconductor layers.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
"Method to Predict, Evaluate and Map Soil Microbial Function for Broad Geographical Regions using Omics and Machine Learning","This invention is a method for predicting and geographically mapping the functional composition of soil microbial communities across a large geographical area and with diverse environments using machine learning. The resulting information is relevant to evaluating soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling.","Microbial-mediated soil organic matter decomposition regulates many key ecosystem functions such as soil nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and soil fertility. However, representing microbial processes in Earth system models is still a challenge due to the lack of a clear understanding regarding the spatial patterns of functional diversity within microbial communities and how diverse environments regulate these communities.",Agriculture & Horticulture
High Protein Soybean Mutants Obtained Through Mutagenesis,"This technology is a method to increase protein content in soybeans using fast neutron mutagenesis. Researchers investigated the effects on soybean seed composition and gene expression encountered in transgenically modified and mutagenized crops and found several lines that germinated well, had no apparent agronomic issues, and continually produced high protein. The approaches used in this innovation will test the range of seed phenotype variation that can be produced from transgenic or mutagenesis that will yield data to establish the comparative improvement potential in soybean production.","Soybean is one of the world’s most important protein and oil crops, used for animal feed, food for humans, and biodiesel. Crop management to protect from pests, weeds, and disease is a major challenge, and herbicide- and pesticide-resistant weeds further challenges. Genetic engineering and mutagenesis are two primary methods to introduce or enhance agronomic traits in crops that can help with both pest-resistance and product improvement.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Broad Spectrum Inhibitors against Viral Methyltransferases,"This innovation is a universal high throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify inhibitors targeting a binding site of viral methyltransferases (MTases) with a methyl donor. The inventors developed a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based HTS assay to target reference MTases, an essential enzyme to methylate the 5’-cap of viral RNA genome on SARS-CoV-2 and flavivirus. Pilot screening demonstrated that the HTS assay was very robust and identified two candidate inhibitors. Binding studies indicated that these molecules bound directly to the essential enzymes with similar low micromolar affinity. Moreover, the inventors further demonstrated that these molecules significantly inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus in cell-based assays at concentrations not causing significant cytotoxicity. Overall, these molecules represent novel and promising candidates to further develop broad-spectrum inhibitors for management of viral infections.","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still persists even after vaccines have been introduced. Similarly, flaviviruses that cause diseases like Dengue Fever, West Nile Virus, Zika, and Japanese Encephalitis have caused outbreaks all over the world and there are only four working vaccines on the market for those conditions. These viruses often are zoonotic or use animals to infect humans. The single-stranded RNA allows for the viruses to quickly mutate and thus evade immune systems and human innovations, making it difficult for vaccines to remain 100% accurate. Viral methyltransferases methylate the 5’-cap of viral genome, so if there is a way to target methyltransferases then the viral genome would be left to unravel and be deemed useless for reproduction.",Life Sciences
Mobile Cancer Screening and Treatment System,"This invention describes a compact mobile system for cancer screening and detection. It can be used to effectively screen and detect early cancer, and has a therapy function where it can provide treatment without the side effects that conventional methods come with (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy). This invention is particularly suitable for low-resource settings and is portable for point of care diagnosis.","Oral cancer is a very common cancer both in the United States and worldwide. This type of cancer is especially common in South Asian countries where it is the second most common type of cancer. In those regions, a device like this would be extremely helpful in preventing deaths because the invention is small, compact, portable, and suitable for low resource regions like the ones the disease is most common.

Diagnosis of the disease in the early stages is the best way to prevent death. The overall 5 year survival rate of cancers in the oral cavity is about 65-66%. However, with diagnosis in the early stages, that number jumps up to 85%. The importance of early detection, especially in those low resources regions is critical. However, only about 29% of diagnosis are in the early stages. The proposed technology would be extremely helpful in regions much like South Asia, or any low resource area worldwide, because it is able to screen and provide non-harmful therapy.",Medical Devices
A Method of Treating Cardiomyopathy,"This innovation is based on the finding that lack of Leiomodin-2 (Lmod2) is associated with cardiovascular issues, specifically enlarged heart or cardiomyopathy and it is better to have a truncated/mutated Lmod2 than zero or little Lmod2 present. A premature stop codon associated with Lmod2 causes truncation of Lmod2. This innovation is the use of antisense for blocking the system that recognizes and prevents the premature stop codon, thereby allowing the truncated/mutant protein synthesis.","Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. Cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure. The main types of cardiomyopathies include dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Treatment — which might include medications, surgically implanted devices, heart surgery or, in severe cases, a heart transplant — depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is. There might be no signs or symptoms in the early stages of cardiomyopathy, but as the condition advances, signs and symptoms usually appear and tend to get worse unless treated. Leiomodin-2 (Lmod2) is a regulator of the actin thin filament lengths within the heart muscle. Knockout of Lmod2 has been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy. The inventors show preliminary results that suggest that expressing either truncated/mutated Lmod2 results in improved cardiac function compared to no Lmod2 expression at all.",Medical Devices
Leukocyte Gene Expression Predicts Human Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Seizure Frequency,"The leukocyte gene biomarkers presented here identify totally new and different genes whose expression predict temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) seizure frequency. This seizure frequency prediction is a manifestation of the underlying pathophysiology of TLE disease states which have, heretofore, not been identified to have a dichotomized genetic basis. Targeting the underlying TLE pathophysiology in a personalized, therapeutic manner, based on leukocyte gene expression, represents a new medical decision-making paradigm, amenable to pharmacologic treatment and surgical therapy. The dichotomized approach will more appropriately target therapy to the genetic and biological pathway TLE abnormalities amenable to treatment intervention.","High and low seizure frequency categories of intractable TLE represent two mechanistically different disease states, based on leukocyte gene expression. These newly identified leukocyte gene biomarkers, for high and low seizure frequency, may direct medical management of TLE by identifying those biological pathways and genes which are involved in the pathophysiology of individual categories of TLE, high and low seizure frequency. These newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized medical management of intractable TLE with anti-seizure medication targeting the specific gene and biologic pathways, which are unique to high and low seizure frequency categories of disease. In addition, these newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized surgical intervention, including vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, responsive neurostimulation and emerging techniques of stem cell and gene therapy in temporal lobe epilepsy. 

Currently, medical management of intractable TLE is based on the clinical diagnosis of intractable TLE. A more tailored approach for TLE treatment, based on mechanistically separate categories of disease of high and low seizure frequency, will allow more personalized pharmacologic therapy directed at TLE genomic and biological pathway-specific pathophysiology for the high and low seizure frequency categories of disease. This more personalized genomic-based therapy should produce improved control of temporal lobe epilepsy, including reduced seizure frequency.",Healthcare Portfolios
Low-Loss Topological Acoustic Wave Device for Telecommunication and Sensing,"This innovation provides potential solutions to telecommunication and sensing devices that utilize acoustic waves as a medium. Compared to conventional elastic waves, topologically protected waves provide a significant benefit for reducing the return loss in devices. Superlattices supporting topologically protected acoustic waves provide attractive and disruptive solutions for designing the next generation of low-loss acoustic wave devices for telecommunication or sensing. Such superlattices are technologically compatible with existing acoustic wave devices.","Previously, the literature has proposed to use topologically protected acoustic waves to reduce the loss of acoustic wave devices such as radio frequency devices. However, these approaches rely on topological wave supporting media which are either difficult to realize physically or lack compatibility with the manufacturing process of existing acoustic wave devices. The inventors demonstrate that finite superlattices in a prototypical device offer the benefits of topological protection in reducing the return/insertion loss of acoustic wave devices.

Historically, the integration of topologically protected waves in acoustic devices presented significant challenges. The consideration of finite superlattices in this context introduces a novel perspective that might be pivotal for future research and developments.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Human-Robotic Mimetic Haptic Control Framework,"This technology is a method for training a robot to perform the tasks that typically require skilled manual labor with a trowel when installing Exterior Insulation Finishing Systems (EIFS). It measures a human’s motions while using a tool (in this case a trowel), which is then used to teach the robot to perform similarly.","Exterior Insulation Finishing Systems are a type of cladding that is added to the exterior of buildings to insulate and waterproof them while also maintaining a stylish appearance. EIFS installation is very labor-intensive and typically requires skilled manual use of a trowel. This technology seeks to make EIFS installation easier, by learning how actual skilled workers use a trowel and replicating their behavior.

While this invention is designed primarily to assist with automation of EIFS installation, it has many additional possible applications where there is a demand for automation of skilled manual work. For example, it could be used for painting, sculpting, and other construction or destruction-related tasks. In essence, it can be applied to many situations where skilled manual use of a tool is typically required.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Angular Tuning of Axial Resonance in Periodic Grating Structures Design Strategy for Operating Multi-Channel CW or Mode-Locked Pulsed VECSELs,"This invention can be used to develop tunable wavelength VECSEL/VCSEL/OPSL sources. This can also be used to tune absorption bands in periodic absorbers or any periodic media. This allows for engineering of tunability of a source. Furthermore, the adaptability of this invention permits the utilization of multiple wavelength ranges without needing to swap out hardware components, offering a seamless and efficient user experience.","Current technologies lack the range of tuning that this invention provides the user. The key innovation here is a method to tune and engineer coherence/lasing/absorption wavelengths as a function of angle for vertically integrated periodic media. Or put another way, this is a way to tune tiny semiconductor “lasers” used in communications equipment to change frequencies (think of it going from red to green) using just a mirror with little prisms and such on it. This novel approach bypasses the limitations faced by traditional laser tuning methods, reducing both complexity and potential points of failure in the system.

In a world that's rapidly advancing towards the proliferation of optical technologies in various sectors, the importance of such a tuning method cannot be overstated. From faster internet connections to cutting-edge medical devices, the demand for versatile and adaptive optical systems is increasing. The inefficiencies and limitations of older systems become evident as they struggle to keep up with the newer demands. This invention addresses this technological gap, offering a groundbreaking method to push the boundaries of what's possible with optical technologies.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Hybrid SESAM Output Coupler,A novel hybrid semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM)/dielectric output coupler has been developed and employed to demonstrate a mode locked vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSEL). The hybrid SESAM enables a greatly simplified optical layout for developing short pulse laser sources utilizing semiconductor based VECSELs.,"Because the hybrid SESAM acts as both the saturable absorber needed to mode lock the laser, and optical cavity output coupler, one can make simple linear optical cavities that support high repetition rates and greater cavity stability. This could be an enabling technology for VECSEL-based frequency combs. The hybrid SESAM can enable development of novel laser systems or as a stand-alone device that could be used as a component in laser systems.",Imaging & Optics
Iron Targeting to Halt Proliferation in Malignant Cells,"This invention comprises a class of tetrazolium-based prochelators for targeting and binding intracellular iron and thereby interfere in cancer cell proliferation or other iron dysregulation. The redox potential of various analogues within this class of compounds can be tuned for targeting of cancer cells. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce formazan species that are capable of intracellular binding of various metals. In this approach, the initial prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The tetrazolium prochelators are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities at micromolar concentrations, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines. Multiple cell-based assays demonstrate that the compounds impact intracellular iron signaling and that the toxicity is associated, at least in part, to iron sequestration.","Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) that affect metal availability in disease conditions may be potential drug candidates. Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger. This invention uses tetrazolium salts as prochelators, namely precursors to iron chelators that can limit intracellular iron availability and cause cell death.  The invention relates to methods of making the tetrazolium salts and methods of treatment using the compounds.",Healthcare Portfolios
LWIR Polarimetry for Liquid Phase Discrimination,"This technology is a polarimeter in the long-wave infrared domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. These devices are able to distinguish between ice and liquid water. Therefore, this device could serve to observe natural phenomena such as glacial melt or be used in solar system exploration when identifying water, in solid or liquid form, on other celestial bodies. Additionally, such a device could be useful in autonomous vehicles to inform the vehicle about road conditions and best practices.","Previously, compact LWIR camera systems were not feasible as the architecture required to operate such a system included bulky cooling systems. However, in recent years uncooled microbolometers have made it possible to reduce the size of LWIR systems. Therefore, such devices have become more easily integrated into a number of systems. These could include CubeSat missions run by NASA to survey Earth’s atmosphere, or integration into autonomous vehicles, or even employment in defense target sensing. In each of these applications, the real-estate of such a device is imperative to remain as minimal as possible. In this way, the proposed technology is novel in its applicability to different applications.

A Hybrid Robot for Exploration and Inspection,"This invention is a design of a spherical hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and ground vehicle that minimizes energy use while traversing extreme terrain both on the ground and in the air. The robot can roll over flat and uneven terrain and, when obstacles are too big or difficult to maneuver around efficiently, the robot can transition into an unmanned aerial vehicle to get around them.","Exploration of unknown areas presents terrain that is unpredictable and weather and temperature conditions that can be extreme. Furthermore, energy consumption of drones and robots is a major concern for space exploration. The problem is navigating the terrain in the most energy efficient way possible with a vehicle that can collect information effectively.
The designs in this invention address those problems. The spherical cage allows the robot to roll on the ground over relatively flat terrain for up to an hour. The propellers on six axes allow the robot to produce the thrust to maneuver in any direction depending on the terrain. The propellers also allow the robot to take to the air to maneuver around extremely difficult terrain for up to 20 minutes. The combination of being able to roll and fly allows the robot to map out the most efficient route to its destination. This design can save more than 10 times the energy compared to other robots performing the same tasks.
Furthermore, the sensors and electronics can either be in a sealed box or outside the inner sphere in the center of the robot depending on the expected conditions. This allows for more versatility in planned missions. The added protection for electronics may also be necessary depending on the required equipment.
Energy is the driver of design, innovation, and expense. While designed primarily for space exploration, this robot could be used in agriculture, space flight, and defense. Covering large distances with complicated sensors is not always possible with a simple drone. This design provides a new solution to a drone-filled market concerned with energy consumption. Previous approaches to conserve energy have included modifying search patterns, mimicking biological locomotion, and slowing operation when possible.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Supersonic Jet Curtains for Control of Moments on Tailless Aircraft,"The invention is a method to improve the design of tailless aircraft, such as the blended wing body design. The improvement consists of using high speed jets to create a supersonic jet curtain to provide flight directional controls. The jets are installed in the wings and are able to control the pitch, yaw, and roll of a tailless aircraft.","A tailless aircraft is a type of aircraft that does not have any horizontal aerodynamic surface other than its main wing. This type of aircraft may still have a fuselage, a vertical tail fin, and/or a vertical rudder. The aerodynamic control and stabilization functions in both pitch and roll are incorporated into the main wing. As aircraft designs advanced with higher cruise speeds and swept-back wings or tailless configurations, Active Flow Control (AFC) shifted its focus to stability and control. Tailless aircraft lacked the necessary leverage for controlling rotational axes, posing challenges, particularly in stealthy blended-wing-body designs without vertical stabilizers and deflectable control surfaces.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
AFC Enabled Hybrid Tilt Propeller / Tilt Wing Long Range and High Speed VTOL Aircraft,"The technology involves the design of a hybrid tilt propeller / tilt wing aircraft augmented with Active Flow Control (AFC). This proposed design enhances the aircraft's cruise efficiency and reduces high-power consumption during takeoff, without compromising on hover, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) capabilities. The control of pitch in hover using an active tail and the tilt wing augmented by AFC not only reduces the power needed for zero run takeoff or landing but it allows the elimination of the cyclic and the edge flight transition to cruise.","The big advantage of airplanes capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) is that they do not need a runway. Since the tilt rotor concept such as the V-22 evolved from a helicopter that is also used for search and rescue missions, long duration hover is a requirement. However, the thrust needed to hover is an order of magnitude larger than the thrust used by airplanes during cruise, thus a large penalty is paid by requiring an airplane to do both. A tilt-rotor aircraft has a short range and takes relatively small payloads due to download (i.e. the force generated by flow from the rotors that impinge on the upper surface of the wing during hover) take-off (download), and due to its stubby wings (i.e. the low wing span is necessitated in hover when the entire weight of the plane is carried by the rotor shafts). It is also expensive to run because it uses the cyclic capability of the rotor for stability and control during hover and the edge-flow transition to airplane mode.  

A hybrid tilt-wing/tilt-rotor airplane concept that is aided by active flow control, can take-off without a runway and climb at very steep angles. It may transport heavy loads or large number of passengers very effectively and cheaply. Its download is reduced by partial tilt and active flow control. Its wingspan is increased by adding an outboard tilted wing, and most importantly, an active gimbled tail that is effective in hover and low forward speeds can eliminate the need for the cyclic motion thus reduce the cost and complexity of operation.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Color Corrector for MODE Optical System,This technology is a system of lenses for use in space telescopes. The optical system combines state-of-the-art optical lens technology with new corrective lenses that address shortcomings in the state-of-the-art optical systems.,"Telescopes in space that orbit earth are typically used for scientific research and surveillance purposes. The aperture size is a limiting factor in the effectiveness of a space telescope, especially when examining deep space for exoplanets or other celestial objects and phenomena. However, the larger and more massive the telescope is, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to successfully launch and deploy it. Recent developments in lens technologies have helped address the weight issue, enabling a new generation of much more powerful space telescopes.

This small-diameter ureteral catheter or stent comprises an elongated body, an imaging system with a combination of lens and an electronic camera, an illumination device, a straightening rod disposed within the lumen of the elongated body, and a pushing rod.","The demand for urinary catheters and stents is increasing due to the rising prevalence of urological disorders among the worldwide population.

Enhancing Absorption of Dietary Compounds to Promote Health,"This innovation is directed to oral co-administration of glucuronidase and polyphenols for reabsorption in the gut. Glucuronidase are enzymes that can be made or derived from any source such as bacteria, recombinant, species agnostic, and others. The inactive glucuronides are cleared from the body by secretion back into the gastrointestinal track where they are not as readily reabsorbed, which the proposed invention will alleviate. This bacteria-derived deconjugating enzyme found in the body can be co-administered with health promoting compounds to enhance the bioavailability of these compounds within the body.","Many health-promoting plant-derived compounds that appear in our diets are consumed in the form of dietary supplements are polyphenolic compounds, which are immediately inactivated by the liver upon consumption via glucuronidation, which inactivates the compounds and facilitates their removal from the body via the gut. These polyphenols are amongst the most used dietary supplements in the U.S., so the co-administration of the proposed enzyme with polyphenol-containing dietary supplements would benefit users by facilitating reabsorption from the gut and recirculation of the original compounds by removal of the glucuronide.",Life Sciences
Novel Modalities for the Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis,"This invention is the repurposing of oxfendazole, an FDA-approved veterinary anthelmintic benzimidazole and its novel oral bioavailability enhancing formulations for the oral treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The oxfendazole ionic liquid containing nano formulations can lead to the development of low-cost oral treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.","Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection of the central nervous system. Worldwide, nearly 220,000 new cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur each year, resulting in an estimated 181,000 deaths. Most of the illness and deaths are estimated to occur in resource-limited countries, among people living with HIV. Improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally has helped improve the immune systems of many HIV patients so that they are not at increased risk of cryptococcal meningitis. However, cryptococcal meningitis is still a major problem where HIV prevalence is high and where access to healthcare may be limited. This infection is extremely life threatening and has a high mortality rate. Despite the severity of the condition, there are few, if any, effective therapeutic options depending on the severity.

Oxfendazole is a veterinary anthelmintic benzimidazole for the treatment of parasitic worms. The need for affordable antifungals to combat cryptococcal disease is unquestionable. Benzimidazoles are potentially attractive antifungal compounds that were introduced in clinical practice nearly 60 years ago to treat helminthic infections. In addition to being safe, their cost of treatment is extraordinarily low. Several studies suggested benzimidazoles as promising anticryptococcal agents combining low-cost and high antifungal efficacy. New formulations of oxfendazole have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability that can treat cryptococcal meningitis.",Healthcare Portfolios

Method and Apparatus for Snapshot 3D Imaging of Mechanical Structure at Resonance Frequency,"This invention is a method and apparatus that can measure the mechanical resonance and mode shape of a mechanical structure. The apparatus can provide important information regarding the structure of an object under different loading and operating conditions. This can help designers and engineers to create a robust mechanical design, to verify the results from their frequency analysis with the final design of the structure, and to monitor change during different operating conditions.","Resonance is a property that is found on all mechanical structures. Resonance can be described as the sensitivity of a mechanical system to a specific vibration frequency (Vogel). Excessive vibrations can cause a mechanical structure to suffer of poor reliability, premature failure, and increased cost of maintenance and parts.

The importance of ensuring and knowing the resonance frequency is high as by knowing at what frequencies a mechanical structure starts to oscillate at its maximum amplitude can ensure that the structure’s functionality, performance, and lifecycle (Blatter).

The beam splitter device also operates as a beam combiner and optical interconnect. The key attribute here is that the device can be used for high-energy electromagnetic applications, such as X-ray, gamma ray, particle beam, and other hyperspectral applications, with very low loss.","A beam splitter is an optical device that splits a beam into multiple beams and is an essential component of many optical instruments. Conventional beam splitter operates either by the principle of division of amplitude or division of wave front. This invention describes a novel type of beam splitter that operates by the principle of division of time. Such a device has a unique advantage because the incoming beam is split by reflection only, instead of by transmission and reflection. Thus, the invention can be applied not only to visible light, but also to x-ray, gamma ray and particles, where transmission loss can be large.",Imaging & Optics
Time to Angle Sorting Camera,"This invention provides a method to sort camera-captured images based on their arrival time employing short-pulsed illumination and MEMS spatial modulator. The time-to-angle sorting method works as an add-on to commercially available cameras. Primary uses would be for driver assistance and autonomous terrestrial/aerial vehicle sensing in the detection of hidden objects under low-visibility conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow.","Camera-based object recognition and autonomous driving based on information, like location, type, and velocity of objects, is one of the critical functions of Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) for automotive. Camera-based ADAS is not only applicable for ground-based mobility but also for mobility in the air. However, all mobility infrastructures rely upon situation awareness (SA) by the camera and other means such as radar and LIDAR (Light detection and ranging). One of the common challenges in situation awareness for urban mobility as an infrastructure is robustness to low-visibility weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow. This invention improves visibility in those conditions by using time-stamped images with short intervals of time.

Quantum Computing using an Atomic-Emitter Array and a Volumetric Mode Sorter (QAMS),"This invention is a completely photonic, utility-scale quantum computer that delivers a superior level of fault tolerance over existing state of the art quantum computers.","Quantum computing is a promising field because quantum computers can perform complex operations efficiently and solve problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve. There are a variety of types of quantum computers with different advantages and drawbacks; one of the advantages of photonic quantum computers is that they can operate at room-temperature, while many other types of quantum computers require a supercooled environment to operate.

While quantum computing exists today, one of the challenges limiting its usefulness is the problem of noise or faults in the information, resulting in information loss or expensive error correction.

Use of an Individual's Own Neural Network-Based Text To Speech Voice in Patients without Vocal Capacity Due to ALS and Other Conditions,"This invention is a software system that helps generate a natural sounding synthetic voice from a small amount of audio files. The audio files can be from an individual’s own voice so that when their speech becomes later impaired, their same voice can still be generated.","Currently, there is technology available that is able to generate a natural sounding text-to-speech. However, these models require large sets of audio files and corresponding text (~24 hours). This poses an issue for ALS patients; ALS patients inevitably lose their ability to speak so it can be difficult to have this much data. By reducing the amount of data required for the model to 1.5 hours, it would relieve a huge burden from ALS patients.",Software & Information Technology
Production of Vulcanized Rubber using Organopolysulfide Crosslinking Agents Derived from Elemental Sulfur,"Methods of vulcanization using a high content sulfur polymer, instead of elemental sulfur, have been developed for tire rubber production. The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking.  Furthermore, this technology suppresses ""reversion,"" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.","Vulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency,  vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.",Materials
Synthesis of New Deuterated Organic Comonomers and Deuterated High Sulfur Content Polymers for Optics and Photonics,"This technology is new molecular design approach to prepare high refractive index polymers with enhanced medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) and/or long wavelength infrared (LWIR) transparency that are prepared from reacting with elemental sulfur with deuterated comonomers.  The polymers described herein are chalcogenide hybrid inorganic organic polymers (CHIPs) with enhanced MWIR and/or LWIR transparency and thermomechanical properties via the inverse vulcanization of elemental sulfur with new organic comonomers. To demonstrate the benefits of deuteration for IR optics, both proteo- and deutero-poly(S-r-DIB) copolymers operating at 3.4 µm and optical diffraction gratings were prepared from both materials.  This is the first demonstration of a functional IR optical element made from a CHIPs polymer that has been deuterated.","Optical technologies in the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR, 3-5 µm) and long wavelength infrared (LWIR spectrum, 7-14 µm) offer important advantages for high resolution thermal imaging in near, or complete darkness, which has been extensively utilized in the defence sector, but has significant potential in emerging consumer markets and transportation.    Current transmissive materials used for IR imaging are based on inorganic materials, such as, germanium (Ge), or chalcogenide glasses (ChG’s).  The use of polymeric transmissive materials would offer numerous cost and processing advantages, but historically have suffered from inferior optical properties and low transparency in the LWIR spectrum.  A major challenge in the design of LWIR transparent organic materials is the fact that nearly all organic molecules absorb in this spectral window which lies within the “IR fingerprint region” (e.g., 600-1400 cm-1).",Materials
Random Multi-Spectral and Polarization Structured Light Illumination for 3D Imaging,"This invention is a method to improve accuracy and acquisition time of three-dimensional (3D) imaging system by using illumination patterns with different spectrum and polarization states and simultaneously measuring the reflected patterns that can distinguishes light of different spectrum and polarization states. Unlike existing technique which utilizes sequential measurements, this invention acquires all relevant information in a single shot and can be applied to rapidly changing scenes and objects. The invention describes different random patterns for projection and an adaptive or “smart” algorithm to change the patterns in real-time to improve accuracy of the measurement process. The projected patterns can be modified in real-time to improve sampling of local areas where there are large changes and high background noise.","Structured light illumination is used extensively in 3D imaging to measure topography of an object. Conventional method utilizes periodic fringe pattern of different phase to reconstruct the surface shape of an object. Different periodic fringes are projected onto the object sequentially, and the reflected fringes are measured at different times. A minimum of three set of fringes are needed for reconstruction, and more fringes are often used to improve accuracy. When the different fringes are projected at the same time, the camera cannot identify and separate the different fringes. The measurement technique is limited by the time to project and to measure accurately the different fringe patterns and cannot be applied to rapidly changing or moving objects.",Imaging & Optics
Method and System for Optical Transmission and Crosstalk Reduction in LIDAR using Polarized Light,"This invention has been developed to enhance encoding methods for information transmission and to reduce crosstalk in LiDAR applications by utilizing polarized light. Instead of using binary encoding methods such as frequency resolved optical gating and on-off keying, this invention encodes vital information into the polarization state of the light pulse. This new approach decreases measurement error by generating a key code that uniquely identifies a transmitter and receiver pair. The invention also leverages the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects to modify the polarization state of the reflected light pulse. To distinguish these changes, the transmitted light pulse can be duplicated or sent in triplicate pairs, and the modifications in the polarization state can be detected by the receiver.","Conventional LiDAR devices rely on the reflectance of the object, and objects with high absorption and light scattering tend to reflect less light back to the receiver. This innovative approach improves on this limitation by considering the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects, which can alter the polarization state of the light pulse. By using polarized light and encoding key information into the polarization state of the light pulse, the signal to noise ratio can be improved, and crosstalk can be minimized.",Imaging & Optics
Method and Device for 3D Imaging and Imaging through Scattering Scenes,"This invention describes a method to create a computational camera that can image through dynamic scattering media with high resolution. The camera can create a synthetic hologram by combining light at two closely spaced optical frequencies to produce a low-frequency synthetic wave (beat wave), largely immune to the unknown scattering processes between the hidden scene and detector. This is primarily proposed for medical imaging applications through living tissue. This noninvasive technique only uses light in the optical wave band and works with standard off-the-shelf camera technology– potentially even with mobile phone camera sensors, leveraging the huge potential of carefully designed optical systems paired with sophisticated algorithms.","
The plan to develop such a camera needs a Synthetic Wavelength Holography (SWH) to image through scattering media and around corners with a demonstrated resolution of up to 800μm. However, the current SWH approach relies on the acquisition of sequentially captured images and is extremely susceptible to motion, making imaging through living tissue impossible with the current method. The current SWH technique also relies on expensive modulation/imaging hardware. The plan found its solution from the spatial heterodyning procedure, which allows for single-shot SWH measurements with the same or similar quality. This means that all required information can be captured with one single camera image in a very short exposure time. Moreover, this approach only requires the standard off-the-shelf camera technology that can be found in every smartphone instead of expensive modulation/imaging hardware. If successful, the camera could become part of a new wave of computational imaging devices that will represent key technologies in the near future.

Periodic Structures Embedded within Glass Mirror Substrates for Reflection to Non-Specular Directions,"This technology is a method for measuring heliostats for solar energy applications, as well as any large optical surface composed of second-surface mirrors. A small diffraction grating, which is a 1D, 2D, or 3D periodic phase and/or amplitude modulation, is embedded within the glass substrate of a second-surface mirror. Light from a metrology system propagates through this grating before and after reflection, allowing it to be directed to non-specular directions to be measured by the optical system. Multiple gratings can be written in a single layer or multiple layers in the glass to provide additional diffraction orders or more complex control of the reflected wavefronts. These gratings can enable metrology of large specular surfaces with compact optical setups, such as a point source illumination and reflection into a camera, and can also be used to re-direct a small amount of sunlight to a direction offset from the specular direction to allow measurement of the mirror orientation while it directs most sunlight to a receiver for thermal energy generation. The gratings are written with ultrafast laser pulses, with pulse duration in the femtosecond to picosecond range, to impart index of refraction variation, scattering, or both, providing phase and/or amplitude modulation.","Large optomechanical structures, such as heliostats used for solar energy concentration, require sub-milliradian precision surface metrology. Due to the large size and long focal lengths of these systems, accurately measuring these surfaces with a compact metrology system is difficult. Several techniques have been developed to overcome these limitations, such as photogrammetry, which is a process of attaching components to diffusely scatter light to the heliostat mirrors; however, attaching components increases measurement uncertainty, degrades robustness, and can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Phase gratings, which do not scatter or absorb light can be more useful for directing light differently based on wavelength, and gratings can be designed to modify the spectrum of reflected light.",Imaging & Optics

Different material choices and λ<sub>2</sub> chirp rates can be used relative to λ<sub>1</sub> with repeatable input output conditions.","Nonlinear optical crystals are being used more and more in lasers and photonics. This technology is one example of how the field is being revolutionized by the application of such materials. It is known that a laser can be manipulated by nonlinear optical materials to create white light, or a range of frequencies.

Adaptive Profile Poling of Nanophotonic Lithium Niobate Waveguides for High Overall Nonlinear Efficiency,Innovators at the University of Arizona have overcome the non-uniformity issue of thin-film Lithium Niobate. Adaptive profile poling is promising to realize high nonlinear efficiency with strong material second-order nonlinearity. Nonlinear efficiency can actually increase quadratically with length using this method.,"Lithium Niobate is inert and difficult to etch. For decades, waveguides have used ion diffusion or proton exchange which suffer small index contrast and bulky, non-scalable, and expensive devices which require a large driving voltage. Furthermore, uncertainties in the ion implantation depth and chemical-mechanical polishing rate cause thickness variations of the device layer.

This non-uniformity has prevented the repeatable demonstration of high-performance nonlinear devices, as well as the large-scale photonic circuits based on thin-film Lithium Niobate.

Biocompatible Ionic Liquids for Improving Delivery of Therapeutic Agents,"This invention relates to three types of ionic liquids (ILs) that will improve the delivery of a diverse array of therapeutic agents. The first type of ILs consists of a drug as either cation or anion and a biocompatible counterion to improve the aquas or solubility and permeability of drugs and to facilitate the incorporation of these ILs into various nano formulations. The second type of ILs consists of biocompatible and pharmaceutically acceptable cations and anions are used as a solvent to solubilize and deliver drugs with poor solubility and/or permeability. The third type of ILs consist of biocompatible cation and anion that, when added to water at a specific concentration, can form self-assembled nanostructures which can package a variety of hydrophobic therapeutic agents.","Low-solubility and/or low permeability are the major reasons that affect therapeutic agents that are already approved or are in the process of drug development. These reasons impact the delivery, bioavailability and efficacy of these therapeutic agents. Thus, ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as the next-generation vehicle for drug delivery.

This invention has the potential to change the standardized products today by enabling faster imaging which in turn allows for more efficient diagnoses. The technology can be commercialized to enhance and improve cone beam CT image reconstruction which translated to a further reduction of radiation doses. Radiation from CT scans may cause damage to the DNA in one’s cells and thus increase their chances of these cells developing into cancer so reducing radiation doses lowers the chances of negative effects from these scans. In addition to this, the per-data self-supervision component of the technique opens the door to its wide adoption across different imaging geometries, protocols, or scanners.",Imaging & Optics

This invention overcomes current limitations by proposing optically and acoustically transparent gel formations, such as gellan gum. In addition, the substitution for water with “heavy water” dramatically reduces the absorption of light due to normal water. These two features not only improve on existing methods that require an efficient coupling medium for imaging, monitoring, modulation methods that use both light and sound but also enable new techniques that may not otherwise be feasible. New techniques include photoacoustic imaging and spectroscopy of lipid and water content deep into tissue.","There are fundamental challenges with efficiently and optimally delivering light and (ultra)sound through coupling materials that are placed between a device that emits and/or detects light and/or sound and coalignment is often desirable. Since air is not an efficient coupling material for (ultra)sound, water-based materials that have similar acoustic properties to tissue are often used for efficient coupling. However, liquid water does not exhibit attractive mechanical properties when integrated into many devices or administered at the tissue interface. As a result, water-based and rubber-based gels are sometimes employed since they possess much better mechanical stability than water. These gels, however, have a variety of undesirable acoustic properties and/or undesirable optical properties.

Heart Valve for Eccentric Orifice,"This technology is a novel heart valve and deployment system that maintains eccentric geometries while optimizing valve function and hemodynamics, reducing adverse events. The asymmetrical leaflet design features two identical mirrored larger leaflets and one shorter leaflet. Traditional symmetric leaflet design features three equal leaflets that rely on diastolic closure with all leaflets meeting in the center and small bending forces needed in systole to open all leaflets. The larger leaflets preferentially open along the long axis of the ellipse and asymmetrical leaflets coopt off the center of the ellipse, shifting the cooption point along the long axis to increase the opening area. Increasing the angle of the commissural attachment further reduces the diastolic stresses. The leaflet configuration relies on alignment of the long axis of the valve between the commissures of the BAV, which no delivery system can control/image at this time.","Heart valve disease, such as Bicuspid Aortic stenosis, often results in eccentric valve geometry and orifices. The aortic valve separates the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) and the body’s main artery (aorta). Flaps of tissue (cusps) on the valve open and close with each heartbeat and make sure blood flows in the right direction. Usually, the aortic valve has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rarely, some people are born with an aortic valve that has one cusp (unicuspid) or four cusps (quadricuspid).

With these features, the system will be able to provide a tailored error correction-based DNA data storage device and a solid-state preservation of DNA data storage to overcome all the existing challenges of high-density data storage.","Synthetic DNA storage is a promising candidate with high density and long-term preservation for archival storage systems. If non-biological information is stored and distributed over prolonged periods of DNA, artificial protection is required because of degradation from hydrolysis, water, UV radiation, oxidation, ROS, ionizing radiation, heat, mutagenic chemicals or nucleases, and pH. Traditional DNA data storage methods have logistical constraints and significant expenses to maintain the appropriate conditions. Hence, effective DNA data storage systems require complete automation in the “write-to-store-to-read” cycle of data storage, high DNA data loading, increased DNA stability, and simple sample handling. Previous DNA data storage studies in solution have clearly shown that degradation rates can be precisely predicted, and buffer conditions can be adjusted to obtain remarkable stability at room temperature. Consequently, several approaches to storing digital information on DNA have been proposed with the error-correction model. However, those approaches are unreliable as they cannot handle errors efficiently and do not suggest how to (physically) store the DNA to maintain its stability over time.",Life Sciences

Research suggests that collagen, a major structural protein, plays a pivotal role in cancer development and metastasis, and by extension patient prognosis. Collagen surrounding tumor cells undergoes structural changes that can be quantitatively studied with second harmonic generation (SHG), a subset of multiphoton microscopy (MPM). MPM as an imaging modality is difficult to implement in an endoscope because of the complex and expensive miniaturized scanning components required. Endoscope complexity can be greatly reduced by implementing a simpler, non-synchronized scanning mechanism.",Medical Devices

This invention provides a solution to remove this polarization change and thereby reduces polarization dependent loss and improves the performance of the reflector. This solution can be applied to both mirror-based and prism-based corner cube reflectors. This invention also includes a method to design and manufacture a corner cube reflector to precisely control the change of polarization using a compensation filter and/or coating. The polarization compensation filter is made of at least one layer of patterned birefringent material. In some embodiment, the filter is used to preserve the polarization of the incoming light, such that the polarization of the reflected light is the same as the incoming light for a range of angle of entry. In other embodiments, the filter is used to change the polarization of the incoming light to a predefined polarization, such that the polarization of the reflected light is equal to the predefined polarization for a range of angle of entry.","Corner cube reflector is used extensively in many optical systems to redirect an incoming beam of light back toward its incoming direction. One advantage of the corner cube reflector is that it can reflect light at a range of angle of entry, making it an indispensable optical component for alignment. Another advantage is its small compact size, which can be tiled in an array to cover large areas. Applications of corner cube reflector include spectroscopy, road sign, free space optical communication, positioning, land survey, laser cavity, distance or time-of-flight measurement, interferometry, navigation, and precision alignment. A corner cube reflector is made of three intersecting and perpendicular flat reflectors. There are generally two types: one made of three flat mirrors, and one made of three-sided glass prism. In both types, light is reflected by each surface three times, either by the mirrors or by total internal reflection (TIR) at the glass-air interfaces. One disadvantage of the corner cube reflector is the change of polarization state after the reflections which is caused by the reflections of light and by the change of its direction of propagation. The latter change component is geometric in nature. Both change components depend on the location and angle of entry. Generally, reflector made of metal-coated mirror has smaller polarization change than reflector made of glass prism. For applications where the preservation of the polarization state is critical, a corner cube reflector that does not change the polarization state of the incoming light is needed.",Imaging & Optics
Method to Reduce Polarization Aberration in Metal Mirror and Metal Mirror Device,"This invention removes the diattenuation and retardance of a metal coated mirror using an additional uniaxial birefringent coating and anti-reflection coating. The method can additionally improve the angular response of any metal coated mirror by reducing the variation of the polarization aberration with angle. The invention includes coating designs, manufacturing methods, and a discussion of its applications.","Metal coated mirrors are used throughout optics for reflecting, redirecting, and separating light. These mirrors are already available due to their low costs and reduced chromatic dispersion. However, a mirror can act as a weak polarizer, and an optical retarder can introduce unwanted polarization aberration by changing the polarization state of incident light. This is one example of many different types of possible aberration in an optical system. Removing this aberration or minimizing it would open a new set of possibilities for reflective optics.",Imaging & Optics
"Interface and Control of Underwater Robotics, Instruments, and Sensors from a Human Occupied Submerged Space","This technology includes hardware and software interfaces to control a robot that may be operated by a diver while underwater, or in submerged spaces or habitats, without a connection to the surface. The invention can reduce the operational complexity from tether management and may also enhance the synergistic capabilities of the robot.","Most subsea robotics currently on the market are frequently deployed from the surface and communicated with via hardwired tethers or wirelessly through acoustic signal transmission. In contrast to this, divers need SCUBA equipment and training to operate underwater.

Divers and underwater robots have operated in parallel, though it is not a common practice to interface for the purpose of enhancing those capabilities and addressing the current limitations of their parallel operation either as an independent system or as a technique. Humans can only operate during a limited time underwater compared to robots, which can operate underwater without physiological limitations.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Rotating Hydroponic Tower,"This technology is a hydroponic system that consists of multiple rotating plant-growing towers mounted around an inner grow light. By rotating the towers, plants can be exposed to the inner grow light at a specific RPM, which enables even lighting in the least amount of space possible. Custom 3D printed plastic fittings allow the columns to spin while the PVC paths are stationary.","A hydroponic system is a type of food production system that allows for the cultivation of plants in nutrient-rich water without the use of soil.  These systems often exhibit water savings of 90% compared to land-based agriculture. Rotating hydroponic towers about an internal grow light allow for tremendous space savings and also maximum light use efficiency thus maximizing plant growth in a limited space. The towers rotate slowly, allowing even exposure to light and nutrients. This method of farming is particularly beneficial for indoor growing, particularly in urban areas with limited land use or regions of low light, which includes the potential for use in space life support. The towers make it easier to manage the system, as they can be rotated for easy access during harvesting. This system offers a sustainable and space-saving way of producing fresh produce anywhere in the world and beyond.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Mechanism of Tissue Regeneration,"This invention is a biodegradable patch seeded with human neonatal dermal fibroblasts and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes which helps regenerate endogenous cardiomyocytes in adult murine, rat, and swine models of myocardial infarction as a cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). This invention details changes in specific gene expression pathways with the recruitment of macrophages, as the mechanism of action of tissue regeneration. These pathways are not specific for cardiac muscle; thus, the researchers propose that these pathways could stimulate tissue regeneration for any tissue or organ in the body.",Regenerative medicine plays an important role in the development and application of new treatments to recover the damaged tissues and organs and restore their functions which were lost due to aging or disease. Current studies in the field focus on the regenerative mechanisms of neonatal mammals and non-mammals that have innate regenerative potential. This new study focuses on regenerative mechanisms on adult animals.,Healthcare Portfolios
Natural Compounds including Myrosinase to Treat Alzheimer's Diseases,This invention includes natural compounds for therapeutic use in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease. The inventors have applied computational approaches to existing rich data sets generated by the Accelerating Medical Partnership-Alzheimer's disease consortia to discover novel targets. There are natural compounds which have shown beneficial effects in neuronal and microglial cell cultures. They are validated to protect neurons from cell death and unregulated microglia phagocytic activity.,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia estimated to affect 36 million people worldwide and an estimated 115 million people by 2050. Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2%. While doctors still don’t know the cause of AD, treatments for the degenerative disease are in high demand.",Healthcare Portfolios
Phase Unwrapping Algorithm,This technology is a novel method of phase unwrapping that improves the accuracy of existing fast unwrapping techniques through revising transform coordinates.,"Phase maps have a variety of uses, from medical diagnosis including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to interferometric surface characterization in manufacturing and synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for geological measurement and object characterization in aerospace applications. Phase unwrapping algorithms serve the important role of supplementing whole number wavelengths to the interferometric sub-wavelength phase measurement for a complete characterization of the surface being measured. 
Generally, these algorithms are computationally intense, and users of interferometric data search for ways to reduce computation complexity without sacrificing accuracy in order to achieve “real time” operation of interferometric scans. Iterations of solutions from Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to solve equations of 2D Laplacian operators is a common technique, though not the exclusive approach. Surfaces with steep gradients or discontinuities present the greatest challenge for phase unwrapping, often leading to higher errors at boundaries. This technology presents an algorithm modification with improved boundary accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.",Imaging & Optics
Druggable Formulation for Mu/Delta Opioid Antagonist for Enhancing Pain Therapy and Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal,"This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR) antagonist which has improved druggability by nanoformulation and/or glycosylation to increase their bioavailability and efficacy. These modified antagonists and formulations provide for enhancement of opioid agonist therapy's antinociceptive effects, reduction of side effects or adverse effects of opioid agonist therapy, and reduced withdrawal symptoms. Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown a significant increase in oxymorphone antinociception.","Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients’ quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear.  However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids.

Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs.
Receptors do not only signal as single units, but can bind to each other to form dimers and oligomers that signal differently from single receptors. In earlier work, the inventors developed a selective antagonist compound for the mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR), and used this ligand to show that the MDOR acted as an opioid negative feedback loop, suppressing pain relief and enhancing side effects. Reversing this effect by treatment with this approach thus has promise in improving opioid pain relief and reducing side effects like withdrawal. However, the compound studied previously is a flexible peptide with poor metabolic stability and blood-brain barrier penetration. The inventors thus sought to improve druggability by developing analogues and formulation.",Life Sciences
Actively Focused Heliostat with Mechanically Coupled Shape Change,"This invention is a heliostat that has its toroidal reflector continuously altered through the day. A simple mechanical coupling is used to change the reflector shape over the course of the day. Dual-axis mounts were found to maximize capability. In this way, the heliostat realizes the highest possible concentration of sunlight. ","Researchers at the UArizona demonstrated a prototype that forms solar disc images throughout the day at the cost of additional motor-driven actuators and a system for control and power. However, the actively focused heliostat is simpler and less expensive; it requires no added motors or control systems.
To obtain a high concentration in a field of many heliostats that all direct sunlight toward a receiver, it must be possible to pack them closely together without the light reflected from one heliostat being blocked by the other. It was shown that the profiles of the reflectors in this innovation, which are rectangles with struts at each of the four corners, allow for this dense packing method. The result is improved energy conversion and a wider range of applications.

","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Target Axis Heliostat with Mechanically Coupled Reflector Deformation,"This technology utilizes a mechanical coupling system that changes the shape of the reflectors on the heliostat throughout the day. In doing so, the incoming light from the sun is always focused to a sharp image. This increases the temperature at the device’s receiver and allows for higher efficiency in converting the incoming solar energy to electricity.","This technology builds on a previous design that included multiple components, which have since been proven unnecessary. Previous barriers to earlier versions of this technology included electronic actuators and power systems required to run it. This new sleek design is simpler and less expensive than previous versions, with potentially higher efficiency than existing solar cell models.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Scalable Synthesis for Commercial Production of Carbohydrate-Based Molecular Scaffold Compounds for Direct Delivery of Drugs or Nutritional Supplements to the GI Tract,"This invention provides a scalable synthesis method for commercial production (kilogram and greater) of novel carbohydrate-based molecular scaffold compounds for various therapeutic and diagnostic applications that have been and are being developed by UArizona inventors.  Oral administration and targeted delivery of pro-drugs or other payloads, such as nutritional supplements, bonded to a carbohydrate-based molecular scaffold travel to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where the pro-drug is released directly in the GI tract by enzymes naturally present. This technology provides a means of delivery of GI therapies for a number of indications without requiring metabolism through the liver or other systemic exposure.","As one example of GI disease, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there.  Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon.",Materials
Dynamically Deployed Communication Network Paradigm using Mesh Topology for Extreme Environments,"The Dynamically Deployed Communication Network paradigm (DDCN) lays a foundation for a distributed, fully integrated multi-agent system that has operational autonomy for the exploration of treacherous surface regions (valleys, craters, lava flows, etc.), subsurface cavities (caves, lava tubes, etc.), and potentially bodies of water (lakes, oceans, etc.).","Mesh communication networks are local area networks in which the infrastructure connects directly and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible to move data. By using reusable communication nodes to create the mesh network, the innovators reveal a dynamic system that can change shape. 

The implication of this innovation is a new opportunity to explore undiscovered parts of the Earth and the solar system at large. Creating a dynamic communication network for robotic or manned exploration offers many benefits, but at the top of the list is the independence and autonomy of a reconfigurable network that can operate in extreme environments.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

A Recombinant Protein to Restore the Anti-Cancer Activity of Immune Cells,"This invention is a recombinant protein that is designed to restore the activity of immune cells that have been exhausted in patients with cancer. This invention focuses specifically on the restoration of the anti-cancer activity of immune cells, in particular natural killer (NK) cells.","Immune cell-based therapies are a widely utilized technique to fight off various illnesses. Notably, CAR-T cell therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment against cancer; however, CAR-T cell generated using exhausted T cells is not effective and continuous stimulation of CAR-T cell can lead to immune cell exhaustion. Immune cell exhaustion causes the cells to lose their functionality and reduces cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Thus, once immune cells, like NK cells, have become exhausted, they become ineffective in fighting against cancer. There are other methods for restoring NK cell efficacy; however, these methods are not able to permanently restore exhausted NK cells. On the contrary, this invention can be used as an adjuvant with immune-cell based therapies in order to restore the NK cells during the treatment and/or the cell expansion and results in permanent restoration of the anti-cancer activity of those cells.",Healthcare Portfolios

"Robotically Applied, 3D-Sprayable Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS) for Building Envelope Retrofits","This invention is an autonomous, robotically applied, 3D-sprayable exterior insulation and finish system for building envelope retrofits. The invention will be able to automatically sense and adjust to any given envelope shape to monitor and control the layer thickness of the exterior insulation. The sensing technology inside the robot will enable real-time alterations during the application of the insulation and finish.","In the United States, there are approximately 126 million existing buildings that consume around 74% of the electricity produced in the country and contribute significantly to carbon emissions in their operation. The Department of Energy (DOE) has found a possible solution in using envelope retrofitting to reduce energy and emissions.

Due to the variations in how buildings are built depending on the climate, materials, and dimensions, envelope retrofitting becomes a large manual process that is difficult to reduce to a one-size-fits-all approach. To solve the problem, this invention proposes a new method to apply the exterior insulation for building envelope retrofits by using an autonomous robot.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Method and System for Passive and Active Agent Delivery for Biomarker and Treatment Means,"Plant-based extracellular vesicles have features leading to low immunogenicity with innate bioactive agents for targeting and/or treating specific biological effects. They can also be used as carriers with cargo drug from natural or synthetic products with higher bioavailability. The variety of plant categories also provide broad resources for lower cost production. Culture conditions may also be cost effective and so these vesicles are promising new drug delivery systems or could also be carrying biomarkers for targeted deliveries. Use in diagnostics, therapies, CBRN medical countermeasures but also in consumer products for cosmetics or food products are other foreseen embodiments.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-size lipid bilayer particles playing the role of cell-to-cell communication system in multicellular organisms through the bioactive cargo they carry such as protein, small regulatory RNA, or lipids in addition to fragments of DNA. Recently, EVs, and exosomes have drawn attention for their therapeutic potential in disease such as neurological disorder or cancer. 
Interestingly, EVs demonstrated important biological functions associated with radiation damage response, such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, the alleviation of oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis effect and proliferation stimulation. Thus, these EVs are investigated as potential radiation medical countermeasures (MCMs) for radiation-induced skin, lung, and bone injuries. 

However, the role of EVs in clinic is still subject to several technical and biological challenges that include the production of sufficient quantities, the risk of mycoplasma and other microbial contamination or their high heterogeneity in composition, size, subpopulations that limit therapeutic applications. Therefore, to overcome such challenges, recent studies have explored the use of EVs derived from vegetal kingdom (pEVs). The invention here explores the ways in which plant-based EVs can be utilized for enhancing the aforementioned applications.",Life Sciences
A Bifacial PV Module Hybridized with III-V PV Cells,"This invention is a new type of hybrid PV module that overcomes previous deficiencies of light loss and prohibitively high manufacturing cost. It takes a complete manufactured bifacial PV module as its starting point, which has single-junction PV cells sealed between thin glass windows. This module serves not only to harvest the energy of diffuse light, but also to carry and cool an array of small multijunction, III-V PV cells to harvest direct sunlight with very high conversion efficiency. The small cells are mounted to the module’s front window on small copper/ceramic substrates. An array of lenses molded into a single sheet of glass is attached to the front of the apparatus to concentrate direct sunlight onto each of the MJ cells while transmitting diffuse light to the single junction cells. A very fast molding process for manufacturing the lens arrays is described in which relatively cold molds are used to form the lenses into a sheet of hot, soft glass. To maximize optical coupling efficiency and provide tolerance to wrong pointing, the concentrating optics include a second spherical glass lens and flat glass plate bonded to the MJ cell. Electrical power from the MJ cells is conducted to the edge of the module by copper wires attached also to the entrance window. In this invention, cooling of the multijunction cells, as needed to maintain their high conversion efficiency, is accomplished by conduction of heat through the base module’s glass window. To maximize the heat flow, copper wires attached to the III-V cells are configured to conduct away heat as well as electrical power. Thermally conductive adhesive is used to bond these wires, as well as the cell substrates, to the glass window.","Multijunction PV cells can now be made to convert sunlight with twice the efficiency of standard silicon modules. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested, no company has yest succeeded in commercializing this advantage.

High Refractive Index Photoresin for Nano 3D Printing,"This technology is a new resin for use in two-photon lithography, which offers a refractive index higher than existing commercial resins. As a result, it greatly expands the capabilities of 3D printing at a nano scale.","Technologies such as two-photon lithography are 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, techniques that use lasers to change the chemical composition of a resin material into a harder material. Most 3D printing requires printing the structure one layer at a time, building it up layer-by-layer.

Versatile Space Telescope for Quantum Key Distribution,"The Versatile CubeSat Telescope (VCT) is a CubeSat-enabled telescope design with an increased aperture and decreased divergence over state-of-the-art systems. It also provides thermal stability, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, reduces the error rate, and improves performance. Finally, it can preserve the polarization of received signals to enable applications like free-space quantum key distribution (QKD).","Designing CubeSats requires a balance of optical and structural designs with cost and size to maximize performance in extreme environments. Increasing the size (ex. 6U to 12U) may increase the optical performance, but costs may drastically rise in turn. Recent developments in diamond turning have increased the accessibility of aspheric aluminum mirrors, which enables a cost-effective regime of well-corrected nanosatellite telescopes. 

The global market for small satellites, CubeSats, and quantum cryptography are all forecasted to see high rates of growth during the 2020s due to high demand from commercial, university, government, and military sectors in the United States, China, and Europe. Most relevant state-of-the-art technology, like QKD-enabled CubeSats, are still in the research and development stage.

Onboard Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC capabilities enable secure, encrypted collection and transmission of biometric data. Relative to traditional battery-powered implants, our system supports higher sampling rates and complex implants with increased power demands, as there is no need for invasive surgery to replace a dead battery.","Implantable devices represent the future of remote medical monitoring and administration of both chemical and physical therapies to the patients. Although some of these devices are already in the market, the security mechanisms deployed inside them to withstand deliberate external influence are still decades away from the robust digital data security schemes employed in modern distributed networks these days. Medical data theft, spoofing, and disclosure pose serious threats that can ultimately lead to individual and social stigmas or even death. Along with that, the need to constantly replace batteries for these implantable devices may cause serious harm to those that constantly need surgery. Lastly, it could cause death if the battery fails or if it is not replaced in time.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Rapid, Sensitive Detection of PFOA with Smartphone-Based Flow Rate Analysis utilizing Competitive Molecular Interactions during Capillary Action","This invention pertains to a system of detecting perfluorinated-carbon alkyl chains (PFAs) with a smartphone by analyzing the flow rate. By using a paper-based microfluidic chip, this invention provides rapid detection of PFOAs in a lab. The procedure uses commonly available reagents to flow through a microfluidic chip while also loading it with the testing sample. Within 30 minutes of loading the sample, the scientist is able to gather their data. The readout time can be as low as five minutes.","Perfluorinated-alkyl substances (PFAS) comprise around 10,000 different human-made agents that can be added to liquids to decrease surface tension with other solids, liquids, and gasses. They are commonly used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foam, and sealants. PFAS are comprised of carbon chains linked to fluorine, resulting in the strongest polar covalent bond between carbon and another atom; a strong bond means they do not degrade quickly. These inert chemicals pose a potential risk to humans and their monitoring needs improvement. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a specific type of PFAS, has been acknowledged as causing significant environmental damage to human health, being present in humans at a level of four parts per billion when 70 parts per trillion is considered the safe lifetime health advisory in drinking water by the EPA. 

Federal agencies are setting advisory levels of exposure and many state agencies are also enforcing regulations of limits on PFOA and PFAS contamination in drinking water. Current testing methods include high performance liquid chromatography, using methylene blue, or using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Using these types of detection requires training and can also be very expensive. Furthermore, the MIP process requires more investigation and the chromatography can take multiple days to return results.

In this technology, the inventors propose the use of a novel system that uses these defense mechanisms in plants to create a modular switch that can be attached to any gene of interest in a plant and can be controlled by the presence of a virus. The proposed Virus Inducible Switch (VIS) design is based on artificial miRNA regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) by targeting synthetic 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of any mRNA.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Targeted Cancerous Cell Specific Suicide Gene Therapy,This invention describes a novel cancer therapy method that induces cell death mechanisms in only cancer cells.,"The current standard of care for cancer therapy in many cases is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, like many cancer treatments, causes significant amounts of healthy cells to die in addition to the cancer cells, leading to the well-known toxic side-effects. Additionally, treatments like cytotoxic gene therapy cause cells to express cytotoxic proteins, leading to cell death. This is a very effective tool but has not yet been refined to only allow cancer cells to be impacted. This demonstrates that a significant challenge to cancer treatment is the inability to target cancer-specific cells.

The inventors have proposed a novel cytotoxic gene therapy approach in which only cancer cells or cells with specific mutated proteins are induced to express the cytotoxic protein that leads to cell death.",Life Sciences
Breast Density Assessment Device,"This invention is a non-invasive, inexpensive, comfortable and portable diagnostic test to screen for breast cancer. Designed for early detection particularly among minority populations and as a preliminary screening tool before mammography or MRI assessment. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a simple, quick, and non-invasive technique for measuring breast density and composition. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer screening through examination of the electrical characteristics of breast tissue provides information on a continuous basis to patients in the field without the need for radiological investigations. Measurement of fat and water mass through established algorithms help assess the standard density and composition of breast tissue and identify lesions and abnormalities indicative of breast cancer.","Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the U.S. and makes up 15% of all new cancer diagnoses. In 2016, 3.5 million women in the U.S. were living with a history of breast cancer. Approximately 1 in 8 women (12%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. In particular, Hispanic and African American women are known to have a higher a prevalence of breast cancer at younger ages.
 
The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are 50 to 74 years old and are at average risk for breast cancer be screened every two years. Breast cancer screening methods include: physical exams, mammograms, breast ultrasounds, breast magnetic resonance imaging, and biopsy. Mammograms entail exposure to radiation, patient discomfort, expensive equipment, and visiting a medical facility. A bioelectrical impedance diagnostic test, however, would be portable, non-invasive, inexpensive, and eliminate exposure to radiation. The device could particularly benefit underserved, at-risk populations through field screenings in rural settings.",Healthcare Portfolios
Trapped particle classification in additive manufacturing,"This technology is an improvement to a rapid design approach for designing nanophotonic devices. It is a method of optical positioning and linking (OPAL) using highly focused lasers (sometimes called “optical tweezers”) used for nanofabrication of molecules for devices, drugs, and other nano-metamaterials.","The <a href=""https://inventions.arizona.edu/tech/Method_of_Rapid_Nanophotonic_Design_and_a_Nanophotonic_Waveguide_to_Fiber_Coupler"" target=""_blank"">previous invention</a> used optical tweezers to position micro and nanoscale building blocks that were linked together using biochemical linker molecules to assemble nanophotonic metamaterials and devices. OPAL offered the potential for particularly high resolution and multi-material integration compared to other existing 3D nanofabrication tools. 

Previously, OPAL was semi-automated in that while the positioning of the building blocks was automated via computer control, the loading of particles into the optical trap was not. It was done by the operator manually “fishing” for particles using the optical tweezer.

The current invention is a method of fully automating the approach using the back-scattered optical signal to ensure that a single particle of the desired size is trapped.

Bioinspired Glycolipids as Fugitive Dust Suppression Agents,This technology involves the utilization of bioinspired glycolipids to reduce fugitive dust emissions.,"Fugitive dust is defined by the EPA as dust that ""arises from the mechanical disturbance of granular material exposed to air"" and common sources of such materials include constructions sites, dirt roads, barren fields, mining operations, smokestacks, etc. Many governments are taking immense efforts to prevent and control air pollution by introducing numerous stringent regulations and standards for the environment and safety of workers, resulting in increased demand for highly efficient air pollution control equipment.

Glycolipids are an attractive material for dust suppression applications because of their effective surfactant characteristics and environmental compatibility: sustainable production, biodegradability, and low toxicity. These materials are advantageous over other materials because they will not lead to salt accumulation in soils; are non-corrosive to equipment; are simple to formulate, mix, transport, and apply; are adaptable to specific needs; will not interfere with vegetative caps; and are synthesized from naturally derived products. This technology would fill the demand in multiple markets like construction, agriculture, and mining where dust emissions are monitored closely.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Plasma from Mouse Stroke Model that can be used to detect Neurofilament Light Chain,This invention relates to the intellectual property that consists of a stored archive of hundreds of mouse blood plasma samples that were taken from a laboratory stroke model for mice under various conditions of the mice age and the time past stroke. By evaluating the quantity of neurofilament light (NfL) chain (protein) within the samples they can serve as an indication of neurological damage. These indicators can then be used to develop correlations and calibrations to other measurements or assay methods of neurological damage post-stroke.,"Neurofilament Light chain (NfL) is a neuronal protein released from cells which have sustained damage in neurological disorders, one of which is stroke. After studying stroke in a laboratory mouse model, the inventors have collected and archived hundreds of plasma samples from mouse blood under various conditions. Once these samples have been obtained, they may be used to determine whether an assay that quantify these NfL levels in human plasma may also be used to detect NfL in mouse plasma. When comparing the NfL levels in mice, there is the possibility of this assay detecting age-related neurodegeneration as well as validating the kit that can detect stroke-related neurodegeneration.",Research Tools
Decision Support Logic for Long QT,This technology is a clinical decision support system that can help to increase the awareness of the appropriate physician. This innovation can swiftly evaluate whether a patient’s heart rate is beating at an arrhythmic interval. This new clinical decision support system will be able to diminish the risk of sudden death due to inpatient cardiac arrests.,"When cardiac arrest occurs, it can lead to limited oxygen reaching the body and brain and cause the patient to lose consciousness. The patient’s organs may begin shutting down and result in irreversible damage. There are over 100,000 cardiac arrests in America alone, and about 6% of them are due to Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Currently very few clinical decision support systems are available for cardiac arrests; however, TdP can be diagnosed based on the QT interval of the ECG. The decision support systems currently on the market may factor in a patient’s medications and their impact on the heart, but they do not incorporate the ECG heart readout.

This technology is able to incorporate a QT score to appropriately analyze the risk of a drug to the patient’s heart health and present the physician with other options for their patient. A cardiac arrest has immediate repercussions and can even result in permanent damage to a critical organ if it persists for enough time, meaning there is limited clinical decision making that occurs at this stage. By using this new software, physicians will be alerted when ordering a drug with a calculated negative impact on the QT score.",Healthcare Portfolios

Autologous Cell Therapy for Diabetes Mellitus,"This technology is the development of novel insulin-producing cells by using preadipocytes from the same animal, which can be autografted. Because the cells are isolated from a small amount of fat from the same organism, the chance of immune rejection is nonexistent. These preadipocytes undergo terminal differentiation into mature adipocytes, which are harmless. The inventors have also inserted an expressing cassette which prevents any further cell division. Furthermore, a suicide gene has been inserted which will kill the cell when exposed to a specific chemical compound. Thus, if any adverse effect occurs, the cells can be selectively ablated by giving a single dose of this chemical. This invention will be crucial in the next generation of diabetes treatment and management.","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a group of common metabolic disorders associated with hyperglycemia. Based on the recent statistics from CDC, 37.3 million Americans (11.3% of the US population) have DM. Moreover, 96 million Americans are prediabetic. Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment for DM, and the chronic management cost for 2017 was $327 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity. The major cause of pathological manifestations of DM is hyperglycemia, and insulin therapy is required at some point for both Type 1 and Type 2 DM. Thus, there is a huge population of diabetics who are dependent on insulin to control their blood sugar. In recent years, there has been an astronomical increase in the cost of insulin and a significant outcry to reduce the cost of insulin.",Healthcare Portfolios

Novel Main Protease Inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 Antivirals,"This technology encompasses the development of novel inhibitors for the main protease, or Mpro, of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated drug target and could be key to the development of  antiviral drugs against the virus. The inhibitors proposed in this technology are notable, as they are potent main protease inhibitors with high enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought forth an urgent need for novel drugs and therapeutics to help fight the novel disease. Demand for an effective and safe antiviral drug has been extremely high throughout the pandemic. One possible drug target that various researchers have identified is the main protease- or “Mpro” of the SARS-CoV-2. The main protease is key to the viral life cycle, as it allows for the virus to make functional viral proteins and replicate.

The majority of current antiviral drugs target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by modification of a cysteine residue by reactive warhead. This technology proposes and tests small molecule inhibitors based on the superimposed X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, telaprevir, and boceprevir that inhibit the same protease.

KM Cells - A Metastatic Cell Line and Method of Producing,"In this study, researchers at the University of Arizona investigated an early cancer invasion event using a unique <em>in vivo</em> model. Muscle invasion was tested by the ability of prostate cancer cells to colonize the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm of male NGS mice, invade into and through to the superior surface. They isolated and compared the biological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of “Inferior” non-invasive tumor. “Muscle-resident” cells that invaded and now reside within the diaphragm muscle of “Superior” cells that have completely traversed the diaphragm muscle.","Human prostate cancer cell lines are particularly difficult to establish, and most existing cell lines do not exhibit features commonly seen in human prostate cancer. Most available models either grow only <em>in vivo</em> as xenografts or are androgen insensitive and fail to express prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The lack of functionally relevant model systems of advanced prostate cancer has limited prostate cancer research and therapy development. However, this technology focuses on the aggressive prostate tumors that invade through a smooth muscle pseudo capsule in a process called extracapsular extension (ECE), escaping organ confinement. The presence of ECE defines the pT3a category in the pathological staging of prostate adenocarcinoma and is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis, and cancer-specific mortality. Although muscle invasion is required for ECE and distant metastasis, the cellular phenotypes that dictate this behavior is not understood.",Research Tools

Method for Diagnosing to Enable Treatment of Overwhelmed Myelin Lipid Processing in the Brain After Stroke,"This invention addresses and provides a solution to secondary neurodegeneration post-stroke.<strong> </strong>It was discovered that foam cells form within primary infarcts and areas of secondary neurodegeneration after stroke. This invention provides for a method of noninvasive imaging and assessment of fatty acid oxidation in the brain after stroke using radionuclide and magnetic resonance-based imaging currently used to measure myocardial fatty acid oxidation in cardiometabolic disease. This is intended as a means of diagnosing, treating, and monitoring inflammation and preventing secondary neurodegeneration in the brain in the days, weeks, and months after stroke. The invention can be used as a companion diagnostic for reducing inflammation, and thus foam cells, using drugs such as cyclodextrin.","The researchers recently discovered that foam cells form after stroke due to the sheer amount of lipid rich myelin debris generated by stroke overwhelming the lipid processing capability of resident and infiltrating myeloid cells. They also recently discovered that fatty acid oxidation is substantially elevated within these cells in the days, weeks, and months after stroke. This is significant because fatty acid oxidation only occurs at very low levels in the healthy brain. Foam cells are dysfunctional immune cells derived from the myeloid cell lineage that are maladaptive for stroke recovery. A promising approach for enhancing stroke recovery and lowering the risk of post-stroke dementia, for which there are presently no therapies, is to target foam cell development and reduction.",Healthcare Portfolios
Treating or Preventing Anorexia Nervosa via Precision Targeting of Neuronal Circuit,"This invention provides methods of treating one or more eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and related clinical syndromes. A new treatment strategy has been discovered, which inhibits two different neural circuits, which rescues all three of the activity-based anorexia (ABA) animal model phenotypes of extreme increases in wheel activity, decreases in food intake, and consequently, life-threatening loss in body weight. Methods of administration for a therapeutic may include electric brain stimulation and/or pharmacological inhibitors of specific protein expression.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a prevalent eating disorder seen primarily in females, which significantly disrupts life and health, to the point of reaching fatality in extreme cases, with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. AN is characterized by self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, and excessive exercise, but also is often co-diagnosed with other psychiatric and emotional disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These characteristics of AN suggest the neural circuits regulating eating behavior and the neural circuits regulating emotion interact extensively and significantly to control AN development. However, studies of single neural pathways show that the underlying neural mechanisms involved in AN, particularly how neurons in the amygdala regulate the development remain to be determined. There remains an urgent need for an effective intervention strategy in treating eating disorders.",Healthcare Portfolios

Solar Hot Air Balloon Vent,"This technology is a solar hot air balloon vent that allows for the release of heated air at the command of a computer or remote control. By controlling the release of heated air from within the balloon, the altitude of the balloon could be adjusted at will. This control of altitude then offers the possibility of directional control as winds tend to blow in different directions at different altitudes. This could be utilized to have the balloon blow with the wind, using no propulsion, to any destination of choice. The possibility of station keeping above a certain point on the ground or executing a desired flight path are also available.","High altitude balloons are very useful in many applications.

The synapse removal tools are demonstrated at various levels of model systems including a neuropsychiatric disease model, to delineate circuit-specific pathophysiological mechanisms. An AAV vector has been developed which delivers a complement C3 fragment or other phagocytic mediators to target excitatory synapses to be removed by activated microglial cells. Based on the initial tool, various genetic tools were designed to remove circuit specific synapses.","Many brain mapping projects are currently ongoing to reveal the connectivity of neurons in the brain. Synapses are the basic unit of information processing between neurons. Each neuron connects to others via 1,000 synapses on average, and mis-wiring or loss of connection via the synapses is the underlying cause of many neurological diseases. To test functional relevance of the discovery, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools have been widely used to control neural activities in circuit-specific manners. Although these tools can temporally control specific neural activities, they cannot physically modify the neural connections. Currently, the physical control of specific synapses in live animals is limitedly applicable while optical imaging, which has limitations such as low-throughput, technical complexity, and procedural invasiveness. 

The synapse ablation tools allow remodeling of specific neural circuits at the level of synapses. The successful development of the synapse surgery tools in patents will allow the address of fundamental mechanisms of neuronal functions and related diseases and contribute to a wide range of neuroscience fields. Therefore, diagnosis of specific neuronal circuits that are causes of neurological diseases and the deployment of synapse surgery to offer therapeutic solution to permanently remove malfunctioning neural connections to restore neuronal circuits and relieve the symptoms is possible.",Healthcare Portfolios
Organoid Models of Pituitary Adenomas,"This technology is a patient-derived organoid of a pituitary adenoma for the purpose of identifying treatment for Cushing’s Disease (CD). The lack of specificity of current standard of care treatments with low efficacy and tolerability makes CD a medical therapeutic challenge. One major limitation to developing new medical therapies is the lack of human relevant model systems. Here, the inventors harvested human pituitary adenoma tissue during transsphenoidal surgery from patients to generate organoids (hPITOs). They utilized several methods to  investigate the organoid model, including a high-throughput drug screen that demonstrated patient-specific drug responses of hPITOs amongst each adenoma subtype. The reported findings of this study are conclusive and demonstrate that from these patient-derived organoids the treatment of Cushing’s Disease may be improved.","Cushing’s Disease is a serious endocrine disorder in which benign tumors release a hormone that stimulate the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. Chronic exposure to excess cortisol has adverse effects on the body, including increased stroke rates, diabetes, obesity, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and death. Yet the primary treatment for CD, which is pituitary surgery, has a disease remission rate in only 47% of patients. Therefore, treatments for CD must improve. This technology is an organoid cell line that models pituitary adenomas in patients. Thus, any conclusions from these studies may lead to novel treatment methods with higher success rates.",Research Tools
"Non-Imaging, Random-Sampling Second Harmonic Generation Measurements to Distinguish Colon Cancer","Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy has become a powerful modality for imaging a diverse range of tissues. A preliminary study demonstrated that non-imaging, randomly sampled SHG intensity measurements are likely sufficient to distinguish normal colorectal tissue from tumor/tumor-adjacent tissue with digital simulation of random sampling. While SHG images have been used endoscopically for tumor diagnosis before, the process of taking an SHG image complicates the endoscope and sets lower limits on the size, due to the necessity of scanning mechanisms. The novelty of the proposed non-imaging measurements is the feasibility of a much simpler and smaller endoscope that returns a quantitative value instead of relying on an observer to interpret an image.","Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, excluding skin cancers, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths when men and women are combined. Despite the high death and case counts, the case rates and death rates have been decreasing the last few years. This type of cancer has a 65% 5-year survival rate. The reason for these decreases is in part due to better screening. This technology will improve screening and result in a continued decrease in cases and deaths.

Non-imaging SHG measurements will be used in colonoscopies and other endoscopic procedures to identify and differentiate normal versus cancerous tissue and identify surgical margins in real-time. This would replace conventional methods for sampling and identifying suspicious samples as it is much more reliable since it gives a quantitative assessment for whether there is cancerous tissue present. The reason that is better is because it is definitive, and patients don’t need to rely on a doctor interpreting an image correctly. It will be very helpful when there are very small areas of cancerous tissue that may have been difficult to see with the naked eye.",Life Sciences
"Diagnostic for Screening and/or Predicting Women ""at risk"" for the Development and Progression Endometrial Cancer",This invention describes a novel method to use metabolic markers in samples obtained from cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and machine-learning algorithms to detect patients “at risk” for endometrial cancer (EMC).,"Endometrial cancer (EMC) is the most common gynecological cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2021 about 66,570 new cases will be diagnosed, with an estimated 12,940 deaths. Diagnosis typically requires invasive sample collection for biopsies and can only be carried out after the disease has progressed significantly.

In this technology, the inventors describe a method by which to screen women for being “at risk” of having development or progression of endometrial cancer. This method is far less invasive and utilizes metabolic biomarker panels and machine-learning algorithms. Additionally, this test can be used in the clinical setting as part of the annual well woman exam.",Life Sciences
Small Molecule Chaperones of CLN1 and CLN2,"The inventors here have identified a method of treating Batten Disease with small molecules that target palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), enzymes that are deficient and less active in Batten disease or Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. The CLN1 and CLN2 genes regulate the production of these enzymes, respectively.","Batten Disease, or Neural Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), is a family of rare diseases caused by the autosomal recessive genetic mutations. Batten Disease is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the function of lysosomes and result in imbalance of the homeostasis of the cell and a consequential build-up of proteins and lipids. These diseases are currently incurable and healthcare providers focus on treating the symptoms of the disorder.

The CLN1 gene is responsible for the production of the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and deficiency of this enzyme leads to abnormal buildup of lipids and proteins. In CLN1 disease, symptoms can be seen before age 1 and progress rapidly. Developmental skills such as standing, walking, and talking are not achieved or are gradually lost. Children often develop seizures by age 2 and eventually become bind. By age 3, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most affected children die in early to mid-childhood.

For CLN2 disease, the tripeptidyl peptidase (TTP1) enzyme is insufficiently active. Developmental delay will usually begin around the age of 2 and children will develop seizures and begin to gradually lose their ability to walk and speak. Brief, involuntary jerks in muscles or muscle groups typically begin around age 4-5. By age 6, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most children with CLN2 disease will die between the ages of 6-12; however, symptoms can develop around this time in some children, and they will experience a slower disease progression, possibly living into their teenage years.",Life Sciences
Design and Application of Novel Ligand-Induced Split-Protein Systems,"This invention is a split protein system that functions as a biotechnological chemically-induced dimerization (CID) tool. These CID systems are useful for biological research to control numerous outputs in living organisms such as inducing the activation of a specific protein, protein localization, and inducing transcription. This novel CID system can be used to stabilize a newly designed ternary complex.",CID is a biotechnological method where two or more proteins can bind with one another and form a ternary or higher complex only in the presence of a specific small molecule or other dimerizing ligand. These different ligands in CID systems can be engineered to induce activation of protein outcomes that can be used to control a variety of signaling pathways and their related physiological outputs and thus be used to study biology and treat diseases. The present invention features a novel approach for the engineering of new CID systems based on the recognition that ligand binding may stabilize a newly designed ternary complex.,Research Tools
Novel Multi-Omics Aging Clock,"­A multi-omics clock analyzes multiple layers of omics data with machine learning to predict remaining lifespan of mammals, particularly for animal model studies. Large omics data sets may be used from combinations of genomics, proteomics, lipids, etc. available from blood or other simple sample collection. This tool can robustly capture changes in this metric following short-term treatment with an anti-aging intervention. This timing reflects the likely point in life where a mammal might expect to receive such an intervention in the clinic. These drugs can then be prioritized for detailed examination in more costly preclinical longevity studies.","Over the past four decades hundreds of interventions have been identified that extend lifespan in invertebrate model systems of aging. One major bottleneck in translating these interventions into clinical therapies to increase healthy longevity and treat age-associated disease in humans is the high cost in both time and resources associated with conducting longevity studies in preclinical mammalian models. In principle, one solution to this problem is to identify early- to mid-life biomarkers that can predict lifespan and other late-life markers of healthy aging. However, aging is driven by a complex interplay between many molecular and cellular processes, and biomarkers that provide consistent predictive efficacy across interventions, tissues, and disease types have been historically elusive. Recent advances use omics data to develop biomarker panels—tens to thousands of individual molecular measurements (e.g., epigenetic markers, single-gene expression levels, metabolite levels)—to develop predictive “clocks” that can, to some degree, accurately predict biological age or related age-associated metrics. Among many potential uses for these clocks, one application with wide-ranging immediate benefits is in drug discovery and repositioning.",Life Sciences
Polymeric Heart Valve System and Method of Manufacture,"This invention is a new polymer-based heart valve designed to reduce stress on the leaflets of the valve while in use in the human body, providing for longer-term durability compared to other polymer-based valves.","According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States: about one in every four deaths is due to heart disease. Some heart conditions can be treated through replacement of heart valves. However, existing replacement heart valves have limitations. Tissue-based replacement valves, which are taken from other humans or animals, tend not to last long, often requiring another replacement later in life. Mechanical valves, on the other hand, last a long time, but they tend to cause blood clots, so recipients of mechanical replacement valves need to take anticoagulant medicine for the rest of their lives.

In recent years, there has been increasing research into the use of synthetic polymers to create heart valves. Many hope that polymeric valves will offer longer life than tissue valves, while reducing the clotting risk experienced with mechanical valves. However, one of the main challenges is in creating a valve that can withstand high stresses over a long period of time. This technology promises to do so through new a design and fabrication process.",Healthcare Portfolios

However, due to low output power and/or large device size the current technologies are not practical. This new method will create tunable high-quality output power while still maintaining flexibility. By focusing on resolving these two concerns, this technology will have significant impact on various applications.",Imaging & Optics
Iron-targeting to stop cancer growth in malignant cells,"This invention comprises a class of tetrazolium-based prochelators for targeting and binding intracellular iron for selective cancer cell antiproliferation or other iron dysregulation.  Various analogues within this class of chemistry can be tuned to the redox potential for selective targeting of cancer cell types. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce metal-binding formazan species that are capable of in vivo binding of various metals. In this approach, the prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The resulting formazan compounds are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities in the 10-30 µM range, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines.","Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) may play important roles in these pathways and may be potential drug candidates for these pathological conditions.  Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger (chelator).  

This invention uses tetrazolium salts as pro-chelators, namely precursors to iron chelators that can limit intracellular iron availability and cause cell death.  The invention relates to methods of making the tetrazolium salts and methods of treatment using the compounds. A prochelation strategy uses disulfide switches to mask the tridentate binding unit of thiosemicarbazone and aroylhydrazone chelators. Upon cellular uptake, the reduction of the disulfide bond releases a thiolate chelator that coordinates iron with high affinity in mammalian cells. The treatment involves a prodrug strategy in which the pro-chelator forms accumulate in cancer cells and transform into the iron-binding chelator forms. Preliminary results have shown moderate anti-proliferative activity in two cancer cell lines.",Healthcare Portfolios
MC4R Selective Ligand for Obesity and Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention,This technology is a novel peptide that has been shown to be a potent MC4R selective antagonist. It is a potential therapeutic for cognitive loss and obesity.,"The challenges of neurodegradation, Alzheimer’s disease, and obesity have been shown to have some similar molecular signatures that contribute to disease and have thus created opportunities for new drug targets for these conditions. Previous studies have implicated low levels of selective melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in both obesity and aging/cognitive decline.

In this technology, the inventors purpose the use of a novel MC4R selective ligand to increase expression of MC4R in patients. This could be used as a therapeutic to help ameliorate neurodegradation or help treat obesity.",Healthcare Portfolios
Receiver Design for Entanglement-Assisted Classical Communication,"This technology is a new type of receiver for entanglement-assisted classical communication, that is ideal for applications with noise or weak signal strength, and improves communication rates over existing solutions.","Entanglement-assisted classical communication describes the process by which the properties of quantum entanglement (such as quantum teleportation and superdense coding) are used to assist in the transmission of traditional information (such as text).

This method of communication can be particularly valuable for applications where a high level of confidentiality is needed, especially where there may be a need to avoid revealing not just the contents of the communication, but also hide the fact that the communications exist at all (covert communication). It is particularly promising for use in communication in space (such as communication with distant satellites), ultra-sensitive military communications, or secure backbone networking for wireless carriers.",Imaging & Optics
Programmable Waveguide Device,"This technology describes a programmable optical waveguide device that can be configured to operate as an optical switch, optical attenuator, interferometer, mode transformer and optical computer.","An optical waveguide is a physical structure that guides electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum.

Optical waveguides are used as components in integrated optical circuits or as the transmission medium in local and long haul optical communication systems.

Real Time CGH Calculation and Beam Tracking,"This technology is a new method of steering laser beams in LiDAR systems. Based upon live camera information, it creates a computer generated hologram (CGH) used to focus the LiDAR scans on specific areas of interest, improving real-time detection and tracking of important objects in the field of view.","Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, is used to determine the range of an object by bouncing a laser off a distant object. When the laser is scanned over multiple areas in sequence, it can begin to map the shape of an object and track its movement. These techniques are used in many applications, including surveying, mapping, earth and atmospheric sciences, military applications, and autonomous vehicles.

To be most effective in a dynamic environment where there are moving objects or the LiDAR source is moving (such as in autonomous driving applications), LiDAR detection needs to be both high resolution and fast. This technology seeks to meet this requirement by focusing most of the laser scanning on areas of interest, rather than scanning the entire field of view equally.",Imaging & Optics
System for Figuring Thin Mirrors Using Ultrashort Laser Pulses,"The inventors have developed an optical system, laser spot position determination process, and calibration process for deterministically figuring thin mirrors by creating stress inside the glass substrate (or other material transparent to the laser beam wavelength) using an ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser. This process is especially useful for low spatial frequency correction of optical components with high aspect ratio (lateral size to thickness ratio).","Current solutions focus on elementary volumes and elements of an optical substrate or wafer. In contrast, this technology allows for an arbitrary deformation map of the entire substrate, determining deviations and deformations of elementary volumes, simplifying the decision-making process, and providing flexibility to optimize laser pulse positions for machine efficiency or process throughput. This technology is an all-in-one solution that allows for the freeform surface height correction across multiple markets that traditional grinding and polishing fail to address. Telescope mirrors, semiconductor optical components, and head-mounted displays are all markets where this device can excel.",Imaging & Optics
Multi-Zone Diffractive Mask for Fine Control of Light Amplitude and Phase,This invention is a mask that can be used in an optical setup to diffract an amount of light based on wavelength. The mask is placed within the focal plane to solve the size-chromaticity problem by using this phase technique. This will achieve better resolution and high start to planet contrast.,"In the study of the Sun's corona, light from the central portion of the sun needs to be blocked while the light of study needs to be transparent. A coronagraph achieves this. In addition, exoplanet finding is extremely popular but is also negatively affected by unwanted starlight.

MEMS-Based Hybrid Beam Steering for LIDAR,"This technology is a LiDAR (light detection and ranging) beam steering system designed to increase scanning range while keeping quality resolution using a microelectromechanically (MEMS) controlled mirror. This allows a single focused beam to be reflected over multiple angles, greatly increasing the possible scanning range. The mirror is specially designed to maintain the resolution of the beam over these many angles.","LiDAR sensing for autonomous vehicles is undergoing a huge amount of research and development to bring down costs and product size, while keeping image resolution up to par with industry standards. MEMS is a popular solution because it allows for more manipulation over the mirrors in the sensor but doesn’t add much weight since small chips and circuit boards are used. This technology integrates a specially designed mirror for image resolution with a MEMS system, to address resolution problems while also keeping a small frame and low cost.",Imaging & Optics

Pseudo Phase Conjugate Image Transfer Device for Head Worn Display,Researchers at the University of Arizona have applied a novel pseudo-phase conjugate technique to the design of a ghost-free and nearly aberration-free head up display. The Pseudo-phase conjugate Head-up Display (PHD) optical engine enables image transfer in an ultra-thin form factor with transparent devices which can be buried inside prescription glasses and sunglasses.,"In conventional HUDs, the optical medium through which the image information propagates is limited to free-space or image guide optics, employing total internal reflection. This requires relatively bulky displays that are difficult to be transferred to head-worn versions.",Imaging & Optics
ASLM Multi-Display,"This technology is a new method that illuminates digital micromirror device (DMD) with focusing, homogenous illumination with cone angle/numerical aperture/F-number configured to prevent contaminated light to enter incorrect pupils. The technology has one input pupil and multiple diffraction order pupils that produce a multi-display from just one projector.","Digital micromirror device (DMD) is an array of micromirror pixels that traditionally are an alternative between ON and OFF positions that direct towards or away from a projection lens for an image projection. Traditional DMD will run into issues where there is light contamination or where the chief ray-of-incidence design is not parallel. These issues can lead to significant diffraction ringing in transmission of light and can prevent high-quality projection.
 
This technology focuses on a new illumination method that mitigates the chance of light contamination to enter and works towards providing a higher quality of projection. The projection can replace the need of having multiple projectors. The technology can cover multiple projections on a screen which allow it to be used for various applications.",Imaging & Optics
Digital Fringe Projection and Multi-Spectral Polarization Imaging for Rapid 3D Reconstruction,"This invention embodies methods, devices and systems that utilizes Digital Fringe Projection (DFP) to generate three dimensional (3D) images of an object based on measurement of polarizations and/or color light in a single shot. Unlike conventional techniques, which require sequential measurements, the novel systems acquire high dynamic range information in a single shot and can be applied to rapidly changing scenes and objects. It's fast, portable, compact, and has low power consumption.","Three dimensional (3D) imaging techniques have applications in industrial metrology, virtual and augmented reality, remote sensing, medical diagnostic, biometrics and homeland security. To achieve 3D imaging, existing techniques, such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR), stereovision, light field or plenoptics imaging, structured light illumination and digital fringe projection (DFP), have been developed. However, LIDAR, structured light illumination and DFP often require scanning and acquisition of multiple frames. Stereovision requires more than one camera at different locations to provide accuracy. Plenoptics imaging requires complex algorithms and computation hardware for 3D reconstruction; in addition, the spatial resolution is reduced.",Imaging & Optics
Computational Photographic System for Depth Resolution Imaging,"This invention is a method for acquiring 3D imagery using an adaptation to existing SLR camera systems that allows for full 3D imagery to be obtained without sacrificing the inherent imaging capability of the camera. This adaptation allows for relatively low cost implementation of 3D technology into already existing camera systems. Through the use of computational photography, wavefront encoding, and structured illumination, 3D images can be acquired rapidly for use in both video and photographic imaging applications.","3D display technology is becoming increasingly important in consumer markets. With the ever-growing interest for 3D technology appearing in a larger variety of media as well as in technologies such as machine vision, the need for capturing quality 3D images is growing. Many cameras made for capturing 3D use two cameras, spatially separated, to obtain a 3D perspective. These systems unfortunately suffer from the disadvantages of being more expensive and cumbersome. Attempts have been made at adapting single cameras to capture 3D by using computational photography and advanced optical techniques. However, these strategies have previously sacrificed image quality to obtain 3D sensitivity. A single camera system that could be adapted to have 3D imaging ability while maintaining standard imaging quality would prove a valuable technology as the demand for 3D media rises.",Imaging & Optics
Tactical Lighting Device,"This invention is a tactical lighting device that accomplishes the same purpose of a stun grenade or flash bang, without the blast and concussion.","Flash bangs or stun grenades are commonly used in law enforcement and military operations due to their effectiveness at subduing and disorienting targets from the bright light and sound.

Software Code for Modified Prime Code Family for Optical CDMA,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a novel spreading/address code family for high-speed, large-capacity wired/wireless or optical communications. The novel ""transposed modified prime codes"" (T-MPC) have specific correlation properties and flexible code size, length and weight. This code family is comparable to existing spreading code families in terms of correlations, bit-error rate (BER) performance and cardinality, but increases the cardinality up to twice that of existing prime code families. Thus, a greater number of users can be accommodated in the system. There is no time-shift feature in T-MPC as in MPC, so the code is not predictable and thus secure.","Multiple access techniques are required to meet the demand for high-speed and large-capacity communications in optical networks in which multiple users are allowed to share the network resources like bandwidth. Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) is attractive due to its potential for enhanced information security, simplified network control, improved spectral efficiency and increased flexility in the granularity of bandwidth that can be provisioned.",Imaging & Optics
Optical Printed Circuit Board with Polymer Array Switch,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a flexible polymer waveguide array structure that serves as a stitch or jumper on an optical printed circuit board (OPCB).

The technology presented here solves these issues.",Imaging & Optics
Polarization State Scrambler Using Birefringent Phase Mask,"A University of Arizona researcher has designed a device to efficiently convert partially polarized and polarized light into light having randomly distributed polarizations, or more generally, into output light having a plurality of polarizations. The passive device provides almost instantaneous conversion of polarization, as opposed to the current methods which use a modulator that requires a signal generator and drive electronics. The novel device will be very useful for telecom, imaging, and illumination.","In fiber optic communication systems, light signals are highly sensitive to polarization impairments such as polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent loss. Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) scramblers, which operate as a tunable waveplate that modulates the polarization state of light, are often utilized to mitigate some of the problems by converting a fixed incoming polarized light into random or pseudo-random polarized light at different times. In telecommunications, the scrambling rate should be faster than the inverse gain recovery time of the fiber amplifier. The scrambler should have low cost, low wavelength and temperature sensitivity and long lifetime.",Imaging & Optics
Optical Compensation of Mechanical Effects for Holographic Digital Data Storage System,"University of Arizona researchers have invented a Holographic Digital Data Storage System (HDSS) that employs optical components to compensate for mechanical instability. This invention calculates errors introduced during the recording process, then compensates for those errors during the reading process.","Holographic Data Storage Systems (HDSS) have the potential for high-capacity, high-bandwidth data storage and transfer. However, these systems require tight tolerances to function properly. Vibrations within certain system components, like mirrors, can cause errors in the recording angle in the medium.",Imaging & Optics
Application of Wavelet Transform Filtering for Processing Data Signals from Optical Data Storage Devices,"Researchers at the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences at The University of Arizona have developed methods for processing data signals that significantly improve the capability of optical disc players to recover data from surface-damaged optical discs. The RF data signal from an optical data storage device is processed and filtered via wavelet transformation to reduce high-frequency noise and limit the effect of defects on the disc. The data signal is subsequently reconstructed with an inverse wavelet transform. As a result, the quality of the recovered signal is increased without altering the information contained in the signal.","Optical media such as compact discs (CDs), digital versatile discs (DVDs), Blu-Ray discs (BDs) and HD-DVDs have flat, smooth and transparent plastic substrates that are manufactured to tight thickness and depth variance tolerances. Optical storage readout devices, such as CD/DVD players, are designed to be insensitive to fingerprints and minor surface scratches, but deeper surface scratches can damage an optical disc to the point where data are not recoverable in commercial players.",Imaging & Optics
High-Throughput Manufacturing for PIC Polymer Waveguide Connection Fabrics,"This invention is a low-cost high-throughput method of connecting silicon photonic chips to one another. The method is active and robust, taking into account the tolerances and variations of the PIC configurations. It is also rapid, accurate, immune to large dimensional variation, and amenable to rework.","Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) combine multiple photonic functions into a single photonic chip. A fundamental problem in the optical packaging of PICs is the connection of optical waveguides of various forms, with modefield diameters (MFDs) of 10 microns in some cases, to silicon photonic circuitry, with MFDs of 300-400nm. The different manufacturing techniques and sizes makes it difficult to streamline the fabrication process for these multi-functional components. There is a need for improved fabrication processes of high speed low loss optical connections between the components of a PIC, between individual PICs, and between a PIC and optical fiber.",Imaging & Optics

Buttressed Haptic Design for Accommodating Intraocular Lens,"This invention is a buttressed haptic that actuates the mechanically accommodating intraocular lens from the eye’s ciliary muscle. The technology allows the eye to change its focal distance using the eye’s natural mechanism of ciliary body muscle tension. The haptic receives radial tension from relaxation of the ciliary muscle to provide anterior vectored force on the lens, altering its focusing power. The haptic does not use barbs and is buttressed by overlying tissue to prevent the intraocular lens (IOL) from buckling and is thick to increase the structural stiffness. The balance of anterior and posterior vectored force prevents displacement of the lens.","Cataract surgery, in which the natural lens are removed and replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL), is one of the most common eye surgery procedures performed in the U.S. IOLs commonly consist of a lens and side tabs, called haptics, to hold the lens in place. The haptics typically are relatively passive elements, given that the focus of the conventional IOL is fixed. There is an unmet need for a more naturally performing lens that can work in harmony with the eye muscles, and therefore, a need for an appropriate haptic to work in tandem with the lens.",Imaging & Optics
Snapshot Plenoptic Imaging Spectrometer,"This technology is a specialized plenoptic imaging system that is capable of not only gathering spatial and angular information but also hyperspectral and polarization information. The configuration of the system is that of a snapshot imager, which greatly increases its practicality and ease of use.","Advanced camera systems generally rely on multiple imaging modalities to obtain cutting-edge information from a scene. One type of advanced imaging system, known as the plenoptic camera, is able to capture not only color and spatial information, but also angular information about light rays that enter the camera. This unique feature allows it to give a 3D rendering to a scene captured by a 2D detector. Other important types of information found in any real-world scene include spectral and polarization information. Hyperspectral imaging can yield great quantities of data for analysis in earth sciences, medical diagnostics, and other fields. Similarly, polarimetric data can provide useful information about object orientation, material identification, and other qualities of an object. Being able to combine these various modalities into one system would provide a powerful instrument capable of combining data in new ways to greatly improve information quality. Such an expansive system could also be adapted to many types of imaging applications.",Imaging & Optics
Fast Volumetric Imaging of Fluorescent Tissue Structures and Activities,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a novel microscope imaging technique that generates high-resolution large-volume 3D images of tissue at subcellular resolution, and captures transient activities within the volume at 100 volume frames per second (vps). The invention breaks away from the traditional plane-scanning approach and implements volumetric projection imaging instead.","In order to study complex dynamics of tissue in live animals, ideally the microscope needs to maintain the sub-micron resolution in deep tissue to resolve activities in subcellular structures, cover a large volume to analyze complex networks, and refresh the volumetric image at high speed to capture transient dynamics.  However, despite many processes, at present there are no known microscopic techniques that fully satisfy the need for resolution, penetration, volume and speed.",Imaging & Optics
Camera-Based Surgical Microscope with Display,"This invention is a compact surgical microscope that provides an increased depth of focus and wide field of view from various angles of the surgical field. Information from multiple wavelengths, including visible and NIR can be overlaid on a single display monitor. The monitor is mounted so that several people can view it at the same time, with no neck or shoulder strain.","Conventional surgical microscopes designed for microsurgery take some time to master and only allow up to two users. In addition, surgeons are constantly having to fix their eyes on the eyepiece. Current microscopes have a low depth of field, low resolution, limited field of view, and are unable to provide other information beyond a stereo view of the surgical field.",Imaging & Optics
A Multi-Functional Three-Dimensional Microscopic System with Structured Illumination and Optical Depth Scanning,This technology is a telecentric microscope design that reconciles the resolution vs. depth of field issues associated with microscope systems. The microscope's design maintains constant system magnification while it performs a depth scan with an electrically controlled vari-focal lens.,"The classic tradeoff between optical resolution and depth of field in microscopy forces a conventional system to take measurements at different depths and then reconstruct three-dimensional data for an extended depth of field (EDOF), a time-consuming process due to the limited speed of mechanical movement and complexity of data extraction.",Imaging & Optics
Method for 3D Nonlinear Structured Illumination Super-resolution Imaging,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a super-resolution microscopy method that is faster, easier to use, and has less artifacts than current super-resolution methods. The result is a 3D dual-color stimulated emission depletion (STED) nonlinear structured illumination (NL-SIM) microscope. Using a combination of low coherent light and time-gated detection, the microscope has improved lateral and axial resolution.","Current super-resolution microscopy allows live 3D imaging of cellular processes at tens of nanometer resolution, but lacks super-resolution in the axial dimension. The systems are also complex and carry a high risk of artifacts.  There is a need in the art for greater axial resolution, and a system that is easier to use with high quality results.",Imaging & Optics
Method of Simultaneous Frequency-Sweeping Lifetime Measurements on Multiple Excitation Wavelengths,"A new lifetime imaging system that can fully measure the FRET network between five fluorescent labels in a single image scan has been developed at the University of Arizona. This technology is capable of performing hyper-dimensional lifetime imaging on multiple excitation wavelengths simultaneously, allowing for previously not achievable FRET imaging of cellular processes. The system also is cost-effective as no pulsed lasers or time-gating mechanisms are required for collecting images, and the design can easily be configured for any fluorophore combination.","Real-time studying of signaling pathways in cells is limited by our inability to perform Föster resonant energy transfer (FRET) imaging among four or more fluorescent labels. Although two-label FRET imaging is routinely used in research, imaging FRET between more than two fluorophores remains highly challenging. Lifetime imaging can distinguish paired (quenched) donor fluorophores from unpaired (unquenched) donors, measure the absolute FRET efficiency, and fully quantify the FRET process. A fast acquisition FRET lifetime imaging system capable of measuring lifetime data from simultaneous multi-wavelength excitation could monitor complex FRET networks in live cell processes. Such a system could be used to help understand mechanisms of genetic disorders, cancers, and more.",Imaging & Optics
Frequency Domain Reconstruction System for Microgrid Imaging Polarimeters,Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed the concept for a camera system that is able to perform polarimetric imaging with ease while simultaneously implementing instrumentation that reduces polarization artifacts. The system uses technology currently existing in handheld cameras to perform polarization imaging in a novel way that allows for quick image acquisition as well as rugged design. The camera is run with one-click operation and a rapid four-image sequence acquisition. This system has potential to be used in a myriad of applications ranging from medical imaging to military surveillance.,"Polarization is a characteristic of light that few cameras exploit, but that can be used to give additional characterization to objects in a scene. For example, it has been shown that polarization can be used to distinguish manmade objects in natural surroundings. Also, polarization has demonstrated utility in biomedical imaging where abnormal tissues may be more readily detected through the use of polarimetry. Notwithstanding the advantages given by polarimetry, implementation of polarimetric cameras has been difficult due to the mechanically high tolerances needed to provide good accuracy and reliability in such systems. Artifacts commonly appear in polarization images due to edge effects and image alignment. Therefore, effective instrumentation for polarimetric cameras needs to be developed to mitigate these effects.",Imaging & Optics
Parallel Multi-Point Scanning Confocal Imaging,"Researchers at The University of Arizona's James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences have designed a confocal microendoscopic multi-point scanning system. This system has approximately the same resolution of a single point scan system while maintaining the high frame rate of the slit-scan system at 30 fps. A prototype has demonstrated that for a 0.430-mm field of view, the in-plane resolution is approximately 3 µm, and the axial resolution is 25 µm. This multi-point scanning system is suitable for fluorescence confocal imaging and can be used for turbid samples. Furthermore, it can accommodate multi-spectral imaging to allow identification of multiple fluorophores and/or the sensing of subtle spectral shifts caused by the tissue microenvironment.","Confocal microendoscopy is an emerging technology that allows imaging of cells in live subjects. The most common methods either employ a coherent fiber optic bundle to relay the image plane of the confocal microscope into the subject’s body or build the scanning mechanism into the tip of a flexible miniaturized confocal imaging device. Slit-scanning and point scanning systems are well known and have critical differences that limit their capabilities. Slit scanning provides high operating speed, but axial resolution is easily degraded compared to point scanning. Point scanning has high resolution, but is slow.",Imaging & Optics
Multi-Resolution Foveated Laparoscope,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed an optical design for laparoscopes that can obtain wide angle and high magnification images of a surgical area in real time. The two images enable seamless registration between the low and high-resolution images, providing surgeons with the best of both worlds. In addition, the innovation enables flexible adjustment of the probe length and offers spatial resolution more than nine times better than state-of-the art endoscopic imaging technology.","Current state-of-art laparoscopes suffer from a tradeoff between spatial resolution and field of view (FOV). In order to see fine details of a surgical field, the procedures are usually performed at a highly zoomed-in view. That, in turn, leads to the loss of peripheral vision and awareness of situations occurring outside the immediate focus area of the laparoscope. At present, this limitation is clinically addressed by manually moving the entire laparoscope in and out of the camera port to obtain either close-up or wide-angle views, respectively. This requires a trained assistant to hold, move, and manipulate the camera almost constantly.",Imaging & Optics
Time-Resolved Fluorescence Measurements in Real-Time,"A prototype instrument that uses fast switching photomultiplier tube (PMT) to acquire real-time time-resolved fluorescence lifetime data has been developed and tested at the University of Arizona. The PMT detector can collect fluorescence data at rates as high as 200 MHz without the production of switching transients. The circuit system also demonstrates a better signal integrity performance, a greatly improved bandwidth, and a faster transient response than any other approach to this problem. This system is capable of generating real-time fluorescence lifetime curves for molecules that have decay lifetimes as short as 80 ns.","Fluorescence lifetime imaging can be used to discern fluorophores that are otherwise indistinguishable with standard fluorescence imaging. In complex biological systems, where many kinds of fluorophores may be present, this type of imaging can become extremely useful. An unfortunate drawback to this method is that it takes a long time to acquire fluorescence lifetime data. Time limitations in detector response and signal acquisition necessitate the use of multiple excitation-decay cycles to build a histogram of lifetime data. Many dynamic biological systems change too rapidly for this type of imaging to be used, and for such cases, the concept of real-time time-resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging becomes very appealing. Having the ability to acquire lifetime data from a single excitation-decay cycle would make fluorescence lifetime imaging fast enough to monitor many short-lived biological processes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging would become a powerful imaging method not only for slowly changing biological samples, but also for high-speed dynamic systems.",Imaging & Optics
Calibrated In Vivo Blood Oximeter,"This invention is a calibrated in vivo blood oximeter that is accurate to 1% SO2. The technology is based on a sensing surface that detects individual red blood cell refractive index. The sensing surface works on the principle of surface Plasmon resonance for individual red blood cells (RBCs), which is insensitive to RBC concentration and size, as well as other factors that make commercially available instruments for measuring in vivo SO2 inaccurate. The mechanical dimensions of the new device are similar to probes currently being used with standard catheters, so the device should be immediately useful when fully developed. In addition, the invention allows investigation of individual RBCs in vivo, which was heretofore not possible. Our device is a disposable catheter-based probe that accurately (within 1%) monitors SO2 that can be implemented through standard procedures already developed for other types of monitoring and surgical devices. It avoids problems inherent with less-accurate in vivo devices, where they are plagued with signals that depend on various factors. It works on the principle of plasmonic resonance, which has been used in other instruments to accurately and sensitively monitor contaminants, like poisonous gasses and harmful biological organisms.","Monitoring oxygen saturation (SO2) is extremely important, especially in point-of-care (POC) situations, like monitoring sepsis, in intensive care units (ICU), during surgery or in emergency care situations. What is needed is a reliable POC device that provides the physician with up-to-date and accurate information about blood oxygen. To date, accurate devices that determine blood oxygen level are only available by first drawing blood from the patient, transporting the blood to a co-oximeter, and then transmitting the information back to the physician. This delay could be devastating in many situations. A real-time bedside in vivo POC blood oxygen monitor could instantly inform the physician of the situation to adjust treatment and possibly save lives.",Imaging & Optics
Sub-Cellular Imaging and Manipulation via Hyper-Numerical Aperture Imaging Surfaces,"High spatial resolution and detection of sub-cellular physiology (like respiration) is achieved using a near-field imaging surface that can be manipulated mechanically inside living biological matter. This new near-field probe is photon efficient, unlike most near-field scanning probes, and is a true imaging probe, not a point source or point collector. The mechanical structure of the imaging tip allows navigation of the probe through biological matter, including inside cells. The resolution promises to be comparable to early SEM studies, but with the ability to image dynamically in living tissue. If the information gained from SEM studies is like a snapshot, information gained from the work proposed here is like a video.","Imaging biological particles with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) has provided biologists with a wealth of structural information, but the sample cannot be examined in-vivo, and is damaged with the technique. Recent techniques for imaging with fluorescent protein (FP) tags have provided an abundance of new information, but there are difficulties associated with their use. For example, the relatively large mass (-28kDa), toxicity and limitation to a single, genetically encoded function are primary issues. In addition, even efficient FP tags only emit a small number of photons before photo-bleaching, which means that the ability to monitor samples for long periods is limited, even when sensitive detectors are used.  Therefore, dynamic changes of organelles, like mitochondria, are difficult to observe with FP technology. Many variations (FRAP, FCS, FRET, FLIP, etc.) have been developed to overcome some limitations of FP technology, but they introduce their own particular difficulties.",Imaging & Optics
Microscopy for the Identification of Oxyhemoglobin Species in Red Blood Cells,"This novel invention combines a Solid Immersion Lens (SIL) microscope with the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) effect to achieve precise measurement of refractive index of a target, with high spatial resolution. When used to examine Red Blood Cells (RBC) at multiple wavelengths, the refractive index measurement yields the variation in oxygen content of hemoglobin across a 2D array of pixels, while also imaging the RBCs. The simultaneous measurement of refractive index and optical imaging of RBCs is extremely valuable where oxygen saturation level also affects the shape of the RBCs, such as in sickle cell anemia.","Current methods of measuring blood oxygen levels suffer from either a lack of high accuracy, such as with pulse oximeters, or require blood being taken to a lab for higher accuracy analysis. Currently, there are no devices available that could examine blood at the bed side with high accuracy. Furthermore, neither the pulse oximeter nor the co-oximeter can examine the blood cell size or shape in-vivo, and the higher accuracy methods.",Imaging & Optics
"A Lower X-Ray Dose, Higher Resolution, Photon-Counting System for Computed Tomography","This technology is an X-ray or Gamma ray imaging system that uses photon-counting to achieve high resolution images with lower radiation doses than traditional machines. The system combines upfront optical gain with high-speed CCD or CMOS detectors to capture images. Then, using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques to parse the image data, the system counts the x-ray photons that interacted with the scintillator and determines their precise three-dimensional position and energy.","Computed Tomography (CT) is an important medical imaging tool that can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and bone fractures. CT works by sending bursts of x-ray radiation through a patient and recording the results with a computer. The traditional drawback of CT is that better imaging is achieved through higher bursts of radiation. Excessive exposure to radiation can be harmful to patients, so doctors have to monitor radiation doses carefully.",Imaging & Optics
Coded-Aperture System for Planar Imaging of Volumetric Sources,"This invention is a method for obtaining parallel projections (i.e. 2D planar images) of a 3D object without the use of a parallel bore collimator while offering improved resolution and decreased resolution degradation with increasing object depth. The method involves measuring the photon flux of a gamma photon emitting source from within the subject’s body in a novel fashion, and processing these measurements with computer software that utilizes a unique mathematical process.","Nuclear medical imaging encompasses scintigraphy (using internal radionuclides and gamma cameras to produce 2D images) and Single Photon Emission Tomography, or SPECT (producing 3D images through use of similar techniques combined with tomographic 3D reconstruction methods). 2D imaging methods utilizing collimators produce relatively low resolution images, and resolution degrades with greater depth of the imaged object. Existing methods that utilize coded apertures and semiconductor detectors for 2D nuclear imaging suffer from increased mechanical complexity while offering only marginal improvements in resolution degradation with depth in 3D objects.",Imaging & Optics
Improved Resolution in Imaging via Spatial Shifting,Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed a method to reduce aliasing of high frequency information from objects being imaged with optical fibers or a detector array system. This is accomplished by collecting multiple images through modification of the fiber bundle. The novel means of collection and the novel method of post processing combine to improve spatial resolution and overall image quality of the final image.,"In image relay systems, such as those that use fiber optics or a detector array, there is a sampling process whereby the detector samples the continuous light incident on it. In these systems, there is a limit on the rate of the sampling process that defines the frequencies of light from the sample that can and cannot be detected by the detector. Spatial frequencies from the sample that are higher than this limit will be misinterpreted as smaller frequencies by the detector, a process known as aliasing, which results in the degradation of image quality. The aliasing artifact is especially pronounced in systems that use fiber bundles, such as in endoscopy, since the size and spacing of the individual fiber cores in the bundle are small.",Imaging & Optics
Structured Chromatic Light Sheet Microscope,This technology is a novel microscope that uses the chromatic slit confocal detection with chromatic light sheet illumination to improve the image resolution and contrast over a large imaging depth.,"Deep tissue imaging is important for detecting and diagnosing epithelial diseases.

"Low-Cost, Compact Chromatic Confocal Microscope","Researchers at the University of Arizona have designed a high light efficiency, high resolution confocal microscope that has no moving parts. The new design is high-speed, has axial scanning, is compact, and low-cost.","Current state-of-the-art scanning confocal microscopes use axial and lateral scanning techniques, such as DMDs for lateral scanning and a tunable light source and chromatic objective lens for axial scanning.  These methods are faster than prior efforts, but are expensive and have low light efficiency. MEMS pinhole arrays have also been used for snapshot 3D imaging, but the lateral resolution is low and also suffers low light efficiency. Light source arrays have improved the light efficiency, but do not adequately address the axial scanning.",Imaging & Optics
Inverse Optical Design of the Human Eye,"Researchers at The University of Arizona and the National University of Ireland, Galway, are developing an innovative method to estimate the full set of patient-specific ocular parameters using wavefront sensors. This 'inverse optical design' method maps the entire eye and shows potential for very low uncertainties. It promises a complete patient-specific eye model, providing substantial improvements in vision science and ophthalmology such as vision correction, retinal imaging, and surgical procedures, enabling research and applications previously unapproachable.","Adaptive optics technology using wavefront sensors is currently making profound contributions to vision science and ophthalmology. It provides eye specialists with superior techniques for studying and correcting human vision, and for the early detection and treatment of visual diseases.",Imaging & Optics
A Mechanism and Method for Synthesis of a 2-D Gamma-ray Pinhole Projection Image from a Plurality of Slit Projection Images,"This invention is a 3D medical imaging technique that incorporates single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to image radioisotope distributions, which are generally used to detect/monitor cancer, drug delivery, etc. This imaging technique uses SPECT to take 2D and 3D tomographic images of radioisotope distributions, both of which can be analyzed separately at high resolution. In addition, the 2D data can be recovered, analyzed and sorted into groups by the angles where the images were taken. This technique can be used in preclinical and clinical subjects.","SPECT technology is critical in diagnosing varieties of cancer, studying drug delivery, and testing to cardiac perfusion. Unfortunately, current SPECT images contain high Poisson noise due to the low-photon collection efficacy of current pinhole collimators and pinhole apertures. In order to address this issue, inventors from the University of Arizona devised this technology, which incorporates a basic detector/collimator/pinhole combination to take images. The novelty lies in the optical setup, which is rotatable, allowing the system to take multiple images of a region of interest at different angles while the device itself remains stationary. Software is then used to process the images and ultimately produce a 3D image.",Imaging & Optics
Improved Illumination System of Laparoscope Using an Aspherical Lens Array,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a more uniform illumination system for better medical images. The system directs outgoing rays from the fiber bundle to provide more uniform illumination, even with extended non-lambertian sources, allowing the full field of view to be fully observed with good detail. It is low cost and can be easily attached to existing laparoscopes.",A laparoscope is equipped with an illumination system and imaging system. Current laparoscope illumination systems suffer from a narrow field-of-view and by a non-uniform spatial distribution of the illumination such that most energy is concentrated in a small region at the center of the field and the irradiance dramatically decreases from the center to the edge of the field. This makes the center overexposed and the edges underexposed so that the illuminated object cannot be clearly observed with full detail. A more uniform illumination system is needed for laparoscopes.,Imaging & Optics
Identification and Control of Myopic Progression Using Distortion,"This invention relates generally to myopia and myopic progression, and more particularly to imaging systems and non-invasive methods for identification and characterization (quantifiable measurement of the amount, type and orientation) of ocular distortion in the human eye, in order to detect the onset or progression of myopia and facilitate control of myopic progression. The methods extend to measuring [characterizing] retinal shape, including the radius and conic shape.","Visual acuity is the measure of the eye to perfectly resolve images from the real world onto the retina of the eye, and is dependent upon the focusing power of the cornea, the crystalline lens, and the length of the eye. The predominantly studied and often corrected ocular aberrations are power error or defocus, astigmatism, coma and spherical aberration. By contrast, there has been relatively little work done to investigate the effects of distortion, a geometrical aberration, on the human visual experience, or to investigate the related biological mechanisms. Distortion is typically ignored because traditional wavefront sensors measure aberrations at a single field point for each measurement. To measure distortion, many field points would need to be measured simultaneously.",Healthcare Portfolios
Trapezoidal Shim for Segmented Optics Assembly,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have designed a paradigm-shifting space telescope technology. The technology produces ultra-lightweight, transmissive lenses that are fabricated economically in segments. The novel aspects of the technology facilitate quick assembly with very high precision alignment.","Improvements in space telescope technology are needed.

Hybrid MOD-Enmat Lens,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have designed an optical device comprising a multiple-order diffractive Fresnel lens (MOD-DFL) and an achromatizing compensation mechanism that reduces refractive dispersion created by the MOD-DFL, thereby reducing the focal range of the MOD-DFL. A method is also provided of using the optical device in an image processing system to obtain images of an object and processing the images to perform image enhancement.","A multiple-order diffractive Fresnel lens (MOD-DFL) operates over a set of higher diffracted orders where each order contains a wavelength of peak diffraction efficiency and each of these wavelengths come to a common focus. For a singlet design, refractive dispersion quickly becomes an undesirable characteristic of the MOD-DFL over large wavelength bandwidths, increasing the focal range across the bandwidth. In practice, this increase in focal range is detrimental to most imaging systems. It is caused by refractive dispersion from the MOD-DFL lens material. A need exists for a MOD-DFL having reduced refractive dispersion, and consequently, a reduced focal range.",Imaging & Optics
Hybrid Pyramid-Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor,"This invention describes a novel design for a wavefront sensor that provides high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and linearity.","Wavefront sensors are at the forefront of adaptive optics, a field that has seen massive interest and growth, and continues to have incredible potential. An essential element of any adaptive optics system is having an effective wavefront sensor that can identify any aberrations in the optical data collected.

Quantum Receivers for Entanglement Assisted Communications and Sensing,"Entanglement Assisted Communication (EACOMM) and quantum computing is the future for many different industries. The unique capabilities of being able to calculate some superposition of atoms between 0 and 1 is a huge asset for complex computing. While the channel capacity for EACOMM has been theoretically demonstrated, optimal quantum receivers have yet to be determined. In order to realize the optimal efficiency and capability of EACOMM, quantum receivers must advance in tandem with the other hardware involved in EACOMM. This technology is a step in realizing the capability of EACOMM and does so with a lower-cost solution. The technology involves the use of several low-complexity quantum receivers employing the optical parametric amplifier as a basic building block.","Entanglement Assisted Communications (EACOMM) relies on quantum entanglement which is the heart of quantum physics. EACOMM takes advantage of the fact that quantum physics laws describes how atoms are able to take on some superposition between 0 and 1 instead of the simple binary in communication over the internet today. This principle of superposition allows for the performance of far more complex calculations which is extremely useful in many different areas. The superposition allows for secure transfer of information through quantum key distribution (QKD). Because each particle is some fraction between 0 and 1, two communication systems are able to send information through fiber optic cables and through a process known as key sifting, ensure that they have the same key. This process makes the transmission of information practically impossible to hack.

All of these stand as theoretical capabilities of EACOMM and are beginning to become reality with several EACOMM applications beginning to unfold in real-time. However, the hardware needs to continually improve in order to achieve the theoretical capabilities of the theoretical channel capacity of this technology. These new quantum receivers enhance the actual capabilities of quantum communications.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
GateKeeper: In Space Debris Detection Technology,"Popularly predicted by Donald Kessler, the Kessler Effect seems to be more of a descriptor of the current low-Earth orbit conditions rather than a prophetic warning. The idea is that there are going to be so many satellites and other debris in low-Earth orbit that collisions between objects may become inevitable. Because of the high density of space debris, those inevitable collisions could cause a cascade where any collision creates a greater likelihood of future collisions. The reality of increased space debris makes space travel and launches more difficult. Furthermore, the satellites that orbit the Earth often in low-Earth orbit are in constant danger of impact from space debris.","Since the late 1950s, humanity has what can be regarded as an obsession with sending persons and things into space. Since then, many satellite constellations are currently orbiting Earth for global communications, Global Positioning System etc. Researchers are constantly working on small, micro, and nano satellites as well as different ways to improve communication and wireless transfers of information. Expansions into space have allowed humanity to exist in an entirely different way.

However, low-Earth orbit now has thousands of pieces of space debris that threaten to damage multi-million dollar projects as well as the health of the utilization of low-Earth orbit space for generations to come. With all of these issues building, projects to bolster spacecraft shielding, space debris collection and disposal, and space debris tracking and avoidance have increased. This technology adds an additional device and method of tracking for debris for satellites.

Silver-Silver Sulfide Reference Electrode,"This invention is a new reference electrode that was prepared by anodizing (electrochemically oxidizing) silver metal in a sodium sulfide solution (SSSE). This results in a silver metal wire coated with silver sulfide. The electrode is extremely stable. The measured potentials for SSSE versus SSCE during two experiments in 1 molar KCl in air were 0.883 and 0.886V. The test for SSSE versus SSCE run in NaCl-KCl molten salt at 800C against the high temperature SSCE was measured at 0.866V. The invention is also capable of operating at lower temperatures than typical reference electrodes, including as low as room temperature.","A reference electrode can measure the voltage potential of a material or liquid in a pipe. Typically, they are difficult to use with temperatures which are under 800C. A reference electrode, when used in conjunction with other corrosion prevention techniques, can help eliminate oxidation of the pipes, tanks, etc. which carry corrosive material. The typical reference electrode consists of an internal element, normally silver-silver chloride, surrounded by an electrolyte-containing filling solution (commonly KCl, saturated with AgCl) which is contained in either a glass or plastic body salt bridge, which terminates at the liquid junction. It is important that the internal element remain wet and surrounded by the reference electrolyte filling solution.",Sensors & Controls
PowerDown (tm) Electric Value Indicator,PowerDown is a unique means of providing electrical power grid information to the consumer to increase overall energy efficiency.

"Sensitive, Low-Cost Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from Clinical Saline Gargle Samples Using Smartphone Fluorescence Microscope","This invention is a method of rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical saline samples using a smartphone fluorescence microscope-based immunofluorescence. This method can detect samples of SARS-CoV-2 in saline gargle solutions down to 10 ag/μl (below single copy level). A saline sample is collected, loaded onto a paper-based microfluidic chip, and analyzed using a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope. The method uses lower-cost materials to detect virus samples in a saline solution and is more sensitive that similar rapid kits. The sample-to-answer assay time is less than 20 minutes. The method also has high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, hitting 100%, 88%, and 93% respectively.","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed society’s need for rapid, low cost, highly sensitive diagnostic tests. Many tests have been developed throughout the pandemic but many of them require expensive laboratory equipment and may have long processing times, especially in high case volume periods. Additionally, many of the point-of-care tests are inexpensive and user friendly, but they often have inferior sensitivity. Many of these existing methods also require uncomfortable nasal swabs, which may expose healthcare staff to the virus. 

This testing method resolves these problems by using a saline gargle solution and a smartphone fluorescence microscope. The saline gargle samples are easy to collect and are easily obtained from patients and pose less risk to healthcare staff during sample collection. The smartphone fluorescence microscope is also more readily available than most lab testing equipment. This method is not only simple and much more cost effective than other rapid testing methods but is also highly accurate.

The need for better thermally conductive materials grows as electronics devices become faster and use more power. High power devices generally give off more waste heat, and that heat needs to be dissipated to ensure the devices remain effective and maintain a long life.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Plagiarism Workshop for Law Students,"This innovation is an online plagiarism workshop consisting of eight self-paced modules. Topics covered include what plagiarism is and why it is wrong, why people plagiarize, how to properly quote, paraphrase, and cite the work of others, cultural perspectives on plagiarism, consequences of plagiarism, and components of plagiarism specific to law.","There is currently no systematic or uniform method for law schools to teach plagiarism. While legal educators can agree that plagiarism is wrong, law schools tend to assume that students come to law school knowing about plagiarism. While some students may understand the basics of plagiarism, they may not know about issues pertaining to plagiarism unique to law school and the practice of law. This workshop was developed as a solution to address knowledge gaps about plagiarism in law school.",Creative Works
Deep Learning-Based Hyperspectral Imaging,This technology is a pairwise-image-based hyperspectral convolution neural network (pHSCNN) that works to recover hyperspectral images from a pair of RGB images to improve the fidelity of hyperspectral images. The technology captures sequentially via a color sensor paired with and without an optimized optical filter in front of the imaging lens. This filter also works to improve overall system performance.,"Conventional hyperspectral imaging techniques currently suffer poor temporal, spatial, or spectral resolutions. However, computational hyperspectral recovery via RGB images has shown promise in that dynamic results can be delivered without sacrificing spectral or spatial resolutions. Despite the promise of this technology, performance still suffers at short and long wavelengths. To improve red and blue bands, the pairwise-image-based hyperspectral convolution neural network is proposed. Tested with a dual-camera hyperspectral system, pHSCNN is trained to reconstruct the hyperspectral images via RGB pairs and optimize the system as a whole. In the technology’s testing it is important to note that commercial filters were used and thus this saved cost on the manufacturing of the optimized filter and allows it to be realized in applications more readily.",Imaging & Optics
New Polysulfide Materials derived from Sulfur Monochloride for Flame Retardant Polymers,"This technology is an approach to using sulfenyl-halide polymerization with olefinic comonomers to prepare a new class of intrinsically flame-retardant polymers for the production of a wide range of thermoplastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and thermoset materials. Materials prepared with this technology have afforded a V0 UL-94V flame retardancy rating and have attractive properties for processing and thermal stability. Two compositions of polyhalodisulfides were tested for flame retardancy by an established ASTM flame test for polymeric materials and were found to rapidly self-extinguish within seconds without debris spread to the underlying cotton, affording the highest flame retardancy score with this assay.","Synthetic organic plastics are a critical class of material in modern day society due to their low cost, excellent thermomechanical properties, and wide fields of use. However, these materials are extremely flammable and are often placed in areas near ignitable sources that can exacerbate the potential problem. This problem is typically solved with the introduction of small molecule flame retardant additives, including halogenated or phosphorous based compounds. These compounds are effective in fire mitigation; however, these flame retardant agents have been under scrutiny and regulation concerns over their toxicity.  Drawbacks to existing options include toxicity in use and in the environment, cost, and/or compromises in product requirements or performance.",Materials
Intracellular Delivery of Small Molecule Reactive Ligands for Bioconjugation,"A protected small molecule probe is delivered intracellularly and subsequently releases an aryl diazonium ion for use as a bioconjugation agent or drug delivery agent. This technology enables a novel chemical probe for observing intact biological cells. It builds on previous IP developed by Jewett laboratory for protection, as a class of chemistry enabling stable compounds that then could release reactive species at biological pH, reducing intracellular environment, or via enzymatic release to elucidate biochemistry. This invention comprises a class of chemistry and method of use for small molecules with functional groups such that four conditions are met:","Selectivity in biological systems comes from a complex interplay of location, interactions, and reactivity. Covalent small-molecule probes offer great potential in the development of chemical tools to study intracellular proteins. A challenge within this area is in garnering selectivity associated with location. For example, in order to gain accessibility to intracellular proteins, small-molecule labeling strategies have relied on working with cell lysate, yet key contextual interactions associated with localization within the cell are lost during lysis. 
Aryl diazonium ions are known for their selective reactivity with the electron-rich aromatic tyrosine side chain. But aryl diazonium ions for use as probes have suffered from a lack of deliverability since they have short half-lives and are generally unstable. 
The present invention provides probes, e.g., protected triazabutadiene probes, that selectively release benzene diazonium ions (BDIs) intracellularly, providing a tool for cellular studies in intact biological systems, e.g., a means for accessing and/or labeling intracellular proteins or molecules prior to cell lysis.",Materials
A Method for Characterizing Adeno-Associated Virus Capsids with Thermal Unfolding and Mass Spectrometry,"This invention describes modulating the temperature of the solution in an electrospray needle prior to charge-detection mass spectrometry (CD/MS) to enable discrimination between the individual stabilities of multiple forms of viral particles that may be present in an AAV preparation.  This increased discrimination provides the operator with a unique ability to determine the stability of the fully assembled viral particles even if the AAV preparation comprises partially filled virions, over-filled virions, and/or various assemblies of capsid proteins lacking a nucleic acid cargo.","Gene therapy and vaccine delivery using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality that has the potential to lead to substantial disease modification in many monogenic disorders, or perhaps even cures. The interest in this approach has been boosted by the recent approval of two AAV-based gene therapies by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Over the last 5 years the number of clinical trials for commercial use have grown tremendously and AAVs are being used more now than ever before.  Differential scanning fluorimetry or differential scanning calorimetry are commonly used to measure the thermal stability of AAVs, but these global methods are unable to distinguish the stability of different AAV subpopulations in the same sample.
The goal of this invention is to characterize the stability and unfolding pathways of adeno-associated viral (AAV) capsids, which compose the packaging for efficient viral delivery. Conventional methods for this include charge detection-mass spectrometry (CD-MS) which reports on the solvent exposed surface area of the complex. The method proposed here would be a novel improvement upon current thermal unfolding techniques.",Research Tools
Animal Attitudes Survey,"This is a survey that is to be used as an assessment tool to measure various human attitudes toward animals. This is the first survey of its kind to measure a broad spectrum of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors towards nonhuman animals. This tool will be used to assess career aptitude for individuals intending to pursue a career involving animal interactions.","There is a high cost associated with choosing a career path or field of study that is not well suited for an individual’s skills or interests. The average student loan debt associated with graduate school is over $70,000 and the average cost just associated with the hiring process for most employers is over $1,000. Therefore, it is important for both the individual pursuing a certain career path or field of study and for an employer hiring an individual to be certain that the individual is well-suited for their chosen field. Career aptitude tests are widely used as an assessment tool for individuals who want to reassure that their skills and interests are right for a career before pursuing that career. There are currently many career aptitude tests available; however, these do not offer specific and detailed assessments for any one field. 

The Animality assessment tool is aimed at individuals, employers, and admissions offices directly associated with careers that involve human-animal interactions. This survey can give detailed information about qualities the survey-taker has that would or would not lend to a meaningful and/or successful career in animal allied industries. This is more specific and detailed than other similar surveys and is likely to lead to greater personal and career satisfaction for those pursuing animal-related careers.",Software & Information Technology
An Alternative Mode of RNA Interference Triggered through Feeding Synthetic RNAs that are Processed into piRNAs,This invention describes a new method of the widely-used RNA interference technique with potential clinical and research applications.,"RNA interference is a commonly used method to knockdown or “silence” genes. This is typically done using small interfering RNA (siRNA) probes designed with specificity to bind and tag certain RNAs for degradation, and by extension, gene knockdown. This technology has a wide range of potential research and clinical applications.

In this technology, the inventors propose the use of a novel system that allows for piRNAs for gene silencing to be designed to knockdown gene targets. This system is superior, as the probes can be designed to have better specificity, longer length, and to potentially produce better gene knockdowns while also lowering the risk of developing resistance to RNAi.",Agriculture & Horticulture

This technology intends to solve this problem through assigning tasks to specific processing elements using imitation learning instead of the commonly used reinforcement learning.",Software & Information Technology
Metal Hydrogen pH Electrode,"This technology is a simple metal electrode that reacts to the presence of hydrogen ion, for use in measuring the pH of a fluid.","pH sensors are sensors that measure, the acidity or alkalinity of a fluid. They can measure pH in a variety of ways, one of which is through use of an electrode. The electrode is placed within the fluid, and the properties of the electrode will cause a voltage to occur based on the pH levels in the fluid.

The most common type of electrode used in pH sensors is the glass electrode, which uses a membrane of glass that is sensitive to Hydrogen ions (which are responsible for change in pH). But glass electrodes tend to be fragile, particularly when miniaturized.

This technology provides an alternative metal-based pH electrode that has no glass membrane and is therefore more robust than alternative electrodes.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Use of DNA Containing Specific Sequences to Prevent Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Infection,This invention encompasses an antimicrobial that can treat disease caused by the pathogen Neisseria Gonorrhoeae (Ngo). The compounds described can be incorporated into commercially available personal lubricants for individual use.,"N. gonorrhoeae (Ngo) causes over 160 million new cases of gonorrhea each year globally; in 2018, it caused 1.6 million new infections in the US. This bacterial pathogen primarily infects the urogenital tract and oropharynx of men and women. It also establishes asymptomatic infections at high frequency; up to 60% of cervical infections are asymptomatic. Ngo has quickly developed resistance to all but one antibiotic used for its treatment. No new antibiotics against Ngo are in the drug development pipeline, and there is no gonorrhea vaccine. The NIH, the CDC, and WHO therefore lists Ngo as a pathogen of great concern and stress the need to develop new anti-gonococcal antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.",Life Sciences
Genes and Polypeptides of Neisseria Musculi that can be used to Evaluate Vaccines and Anti-Bacterial Compounds against Infection by Pathogenic Neisseria Species,"A set of Neisseria musculi (Nmus) genes have been identified which promote Nmus infection and persistence in its natural host, the mouse. These genes have never been described before, so the in-host function of their encoded proteins is unknown. These genes are present in the human pathogenic Neisseria, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. These genes and/or their encoded proteins are therefore potential targets for vaccines and antimicrobials against N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae.","The proposed technology can be potentially used treat both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae by being an antimicrobial treatment and a vaccine possibility. The new genes identified make it an extremely versatile proposition that would be extremely useful and convenient.
N. meningitidis can cause some serious illnesses including meningococcal disease. This disease can be extremely harmful to young adults and adolescents, necessitating the need for vaccination. The other application of this proposed technology would be developing a treatment for N. gonorrhoeae, which is extremely prevalent in the United States. In 2019, over 616,000 people were impacted and it continues to be a growing issue. Infection rates have increased by over 50% overall for people from 2015-2019. It is an issue that could use some new treatment technology to help those and keep the serious cases to a minimum.",Healthcare Portfolios
Peptides Targeting Inositols Mediated Proliferative Signaling for Treating Cancers and other Proliferative Disorders,This invention describes a method that efficiently stops the growth of cancer cells or over-proliferative cells without causing adverse cytotoxic effects on the body’s healthy organs and tissues. This technology focuses on the IMPA1/RAGE complex and its ability to control cell proliferation.,"Proliferative disorders include a wide variety of diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma, and more. Hundreds of thousands of individuals suffer from these disorders. Cell proliferation can be triggered by the binding between Inositol monophosphate 1 (IMPA1) enzyme the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). The inventors here have identified peptide inhibitors designed to block the interaction between IMPA1 and RAGE and inhibit the downstream proliferative signaling. To note, these peptide inhibitors are a unique therapeutic strategy that can selectively arrest the growth of over-proliferative cells in patients with cancers and other proliferative disorders without producing any toxicity on the healthy cell population.",Healthcare Portfolios
Sex and APOE Genotype Precision Therapeutic Targets Discovery for Alzheimer’s Disease,"This technology encompasses a formulation for patient subgroup-specific supplement for the treatment and therapy of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. These formulations can range in delivery method (food, drink, pill) and can be specific to patient subgroups.","Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder with few effective therapies and no cures. Additionally, cases and prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease are only projected to rise in the coming years. One of the challenging parts of Alzheimer’s disease is that it impacts different patients from different subgroups (age, gender, genetics) differently.
There are several drugs on the market that are effective in treating dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease, but none of them are curative, nor particularly specific to any patient subgroups.

Method of Treating Acute Lung Injury Using Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Analogs Or Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor Agonists,"This invention describes a method to treat and reduce the risk for acute lung injury (ALI) associated with radiation, infection, trauma, and other environmental-related lung injury. The method described involves the administration of analogs or derivatives of a Sphingosine 1 Phosphate (S1P) receptor agonists that have similar properties of S1P that similarly reduce infection and radiation-associated ALI.","Acute lung injury (ALI) is a dangerous lung inflammation that develops in response to pulmonary and generalized acute diseases. It is commonly associated with sepsis, an infection that may lead to vascular leakage. The incidence of ALI in the United States is estimated to be around 200,000 with a mortality rate of 40%.

Current treatments for ALI do not have long-term efficacy and in many cases involve invasive machines, such as CPAP machines. This technology is a novel pharmaceutical method of treating and preventing ALI by enhancing the endothelial cell barrier, limiting the prevalence of vascular leakage as a result of sepsis. This in turn can limit the occurrence of ALI.",Life Sciences
Peptide-Based Modulators of HMGBl Activity Protect Against Cell Damage and Inflammation,"This technology assists with the inhibition of HMGB1 to decrease the body’s inflammatory response, which occurs when the HMGB1 protein binds to DNA and TLR4. By decreasing HMGB1 binding to DNA, cell inflammation can be significantly reduced, thus preventing further cell damage. This technology can be used in a large spectrum of diseases, such as: diabetic complications, hypertension, systemic inflammation, acute chronic heart, kidney, and liver diseases.","Chronic cell inflammation plays a pivotal role in cell damage and inflammation to the body’s cells is a major side effect in many different diseases. Current technologies that aim at trying to reduce cell inflammation are to supplement the body with foods that have anti-inflammatory properties, as well as the use of infrared led exposure. However, oftentimes eating these certain foods may not be sufficient enough to repair excessive inflammation. Infrared light exposure can cause numerous side effects, such as irritability and insomnia. By inhibiting HMGB1 using peptide-based modulators, the body’s natural response to trigger inflammation can be decreased. This new technology prohibits the release of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory proteins, which typically occur when HMGB1 binds to DNA and TLR4.",Life Sciences
Carbon Capture Using Microalgae Cultivated in Scalable Photobioreactors Paired with a Particle Filtration System,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a method to offset carbon emissions for industries where carbon-neutral operations are particularly challenging (e.g., airlines, shipping). This invention offers a method to offset carbon emissions for industries where carbon-neutral operations are particularly challenging (e.g., airlines, shipping). This invention offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by utilizing a novel combination of a UArizona patented, low-cost photobioreactor system, which has an excellent track record of growing photosynthetic algae, and a particle filtration system. Due to the intrinsic scalability of this invention, it has a potential to provide the most cost-effective solution to massive (hundreds of Ktons to Gtons-level) CO<sub>2</sub> extraction, thereby contributing to reducing the impact of climate change and meeting demands for such capabilities if carbon taxes are introduced worldwide.","Transitioning industrial processes worldwide to carbon-neutral operations is a necessity yet an enormously expensive technological and economic challenge. If companies can utilize reliable sources of carbon offsetting, then the total world emissions will greatly decrease, and we can slow the impacts of global warming. Energy is the number one cause of greenhouse gas emissions which is why this invention is an attractive alternative for shipping companies, airlines, and data centers where energy and fuel use is inevitable.

Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 43% from 1990 to 2015. If the number keeps growing at that rate, global warming will be irreversible, and the impact will be massive. As more and more companies pledge to become carbon neutral, it has become difficult to find scalable solutions that are cost-effective. The invention described here offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO<sub>2</sub> from ocean water (a gigantic reservoir of CO<sub>2</sub> that is coupled to the atmosphere) by utilizing a novel combination of photobioreactor and particle filtration system. Three regions of the world (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the United States) account for about 74% of the total emissions. If companies in these regions can utilize reliable sources of carbon offsetting, then the total world emissions will greatly decrease, and we can slow the impacts of global warming.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
3D Printed Epifluidics,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a method to print wearable sweat collection devices to that enable 24/7 sweat collection over weeks without the use of adhesives. This technology provides an easily manufacturable method for producing these devices with accurate control over channel design and integration with electrical components, enabling continuous, quantitative detection of biomarkers not possible with current technology. The invention enables FDM printing of microfluidics with soft materials for direct application on the skin without adhesives. This is enabled by a specially designed seal to capture sweat over extended periods of time, enabling a multitude of integration options. This technology can be employed in conjunction with 3D scanning and electronic mesh technology.","Epifluidics is a growing industry in medical monitoring and eccrine sweat is currently used and researched to understand more about medical conditions in the human body. The disclosed technology uses 3D printing to form the 3D channels that collect sweat from the user and detect properties within the sweat. Furthermore, the 3D printing allows for integration with electronics and therefore automated, continuous biodata from the sweat.

Flight Duration Enhancement for Single Rotorcraft and Multicopters,"This invention is an optimization methodology for key dimensions of rotorcraft shroud, nozzle, cover, and turbine designs as well as specific optimized designs that will result in prolonged flight time, reduced damage to the rotorcraft from ground effects, enhanced safety, and reduced noise. The invention seeks to alleviate the shortcoming of the short operability periods of these increasingly popular drones. The prolonging of flight duration of single rotorcraft and other multicopters can occur, through the invention, with a net-zero overall mass increase of the aircraft.","The term “drone” (referring here to rotorcraft and multicopters) has become increasingly more popular throughout the world for various uses, including aerial video-photography, reconnaissance, surveillance, exploration, and delivery. These uses are helpful in dynamic industries including packaging, explosives, etc. Further, an interesting new expansion is multicopters being used, or at least considered to be used, for the transportation of people (so-called “air-taxis”). Thus, one of the biggest challenges facing this expanded market and technology is the relatively short period in which they are operable. This is especially true when they are compared to other aerial vehicles.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
A Web-Based Bayesian Disease Recommender System,This technology is a disease recommendation system that assesses a given set of diagnoses that a patient has and identifies possible co-morbidities. The system can be used by doctors to discover additional diseases in their patients or by hospitals to discover codes that may have been missed during the billing process.,"There is significant need for new software and systems to help improve healthcare. As the global population ages and the incidence of chronic disease rises, there is an increasing need to find ways to efficiently provide healthcare and diagnostic services in the most accurate way possible.

Patients frequently experience more than one disease at the same time, which can make diagnosis difficult, sometimes resulting in some of the conditions being missed by the healthcare provider. Also, secondary diseases may be in the process of developing in a patient but not yet manifested. This technology addresses these issues by predicting any additional disease given a set of primary diagnoses, and empowers the healthcare provider by including an accompanying probability.",Software & Information Technology
mmWave Radar Based System for Extracting Human Skeleton,"Millimeter-wave technology offers users detailed views of body parts through walls or other obstructions. This invention generates and measures an RF signal (millimeter wave) and processes the data with machine learning to extract and identify body motion within a region.  Unlike other systems that focus on breathing or heart rate, this system can distinguish larger scale motions of specific limbs.","Currently, there are several technologies that are able to provide imaging of humans through a wall or another obstruction. These technologies rely on identifying vital signs like minor chest movements during breaths to detect humans, but these can be inaccurately recorded in complex environments. The tracking of skeletal structure motions would enable more detailed and accurate imaging.
 
Clothing is highly transparent in the millimeter-wave band of electromagnetic radiation which makes millimeter-wave sensors an obvious choice for security screening purposes. Passive and active millimeter wave systems are commonly used to detect concealed objects. However, the nature of this longer-wave technology far outside the visible wavelength range makes image processing of the data collected more intensive; the data must be heavily analyzed to create 2D images. Therefore, it is advantageous to use efficient algorithms for faster frame rates.
 
As an alternative to monitoring systems, some groups are investigating uses of RFID chips because they have become cheaper with longer lasting battery life. Yet, these require multiple chips for multiple motions and have applications more for specific medical purposes than remote monitoring.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
The Closed Loop Comfort-Cost Control Thermostat and Monitor,"This technology utilizes a novel management framework for thermostats targeted towards the end-user. Using a data-driven prediction component to learn data relationships, this technology predicts future HVAC loads within a given time frame. In its totality, the cost-effective hardware monitor with cloud-based computation and control calculations has the potential to help homeowners or building operators predict their HVAC load and plan accordingly for costs.","Thermostats often use closed-loop controls which require a state-update function and frequent modifications of the optimization functions. Overall, the standard techniques for close-loop controls are inefficient and disturbances can have high impacts on performance of the thermostat. This technology makes the closed-loop control more efficient and allows users to predict how much their HVAC will cost.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Quantum-Enhanced Gyroscopes,This technology is a new type of laser gyroscope that makes use of concepts of quantum squeezing and quantum entanglement to offer improved sensitivity over existing laser gyroscopes.,"Laser gyroscopes use laser interferometry to measure changes in their rotation or orientation. They use no (or few) moving parts, unlike traditional mechanical gyroscopes which rely on the inertial properties of a spinning wheel or disc to measure rotation. They are most frequently used in the aerospace and defense industries, as they are lightweight, compact, and resilient.

However, most laser gyroscopes have limited resolution or precision, and often produce a degree of noise in its measurements. As a result, there is a need to provide techniques to improve the performance of laser gyroscopes to make them more useful. This technology uses quantum squeezing (a method of reducing quantum uncertainty in photons) or quantum entanglement to improve precision of existing laser gyroscope technologies.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Entanglement Assisted Communication with Optical Phase Conjugation on Transmitter Side,"Entanglement -Assisted (EA) Communication and Sensing has been advocated by numerous authors as a potential alternative to classical communications, in particular in noisy and low-brightness regime. This technology proposes an EA scheme employing the optical phase-conjugation (OPC) on transmitter side. It shows that the proposed EA communication system, with the transmitter side OPC, significantly outperforms its classical counterpart in low-brightness and highly noisy regime, while employing a classical coherent detection scheme for two-dimensional demodulation. Moreover, the capacity of the proposed EA scheme is significantly higher than EA repetition-BPSK, homodyne, heterodyne, and Holevo capacities. Finally, the proposed EA scheme outperforms the corresponding EA scheme with OPC placed on a receiver side.","The problem with quantum entanglement devices is that they are easily electromagnetically (meaning light, magnetism, etc) interfered with. It is particularly difficult for the transmitter (the sender of the signal) to send information to the receiver. This tech solves the problem using Optical Phase Conjugation: process where an incoming electromagnetic wave is reflected with a reversed phase, so called “time-reversal of electromagnetic waves,” allows cancellation of spatial distortion introduced into the incoming beam.Think of it as a way to outright screen off static.This communication is being investigated by NASA and other large entities could disrupt the current transmitter markets.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Adaptive Scale Factor Compensation using Predictive Coding,"This technology is a method of compensating for both look angle dependent radome refraction and rate gyro scale factor errors using deep learning technology, significantly improving the accuracy and effectiveness of a guidance and control system.","Look angle dependent radome refraction (which can be modeled as a time varying scale factor error applied to the line of sight direction vector) can create a false indication of target motion, potentially destabilizing a guidance and control system. Similarly, rate gyro scale factor errors create a time-varying bias in the integrated rotational velocity, which is used to estimate the change in vehicle attitude over the trajectory. When this biased change in attitude is then used to stabilize a seeker platform, either computationally in the case of strap down seekers or mechanically in the case of gimballed seekers, imperfect stabilization occurs, again leading to a false indication of target motion. Prior art to compensate for these errors typically estimates the scale factors using a bank of Kalman filters using adaptive models.

However, since these models typically adapt only parameters in the ordinary differential equations describing the equations of motion, performance suffers when the structure of the model differs from the actual deployment environment. In contrast, our approach can learn a more expressive representation of the dynamics, and quickly adapt to the actual deployment environment.

This technology is a novel method for adaptively correcting sensor scale factor errors using deep learning techniques to predict both the rotational velocity and line of sight scale factor errors, and compensate for these errors using the predictions, improving the performance of a guidance and control system.",Software & Information Technology
Compressing Ion-Beam Shutter,"The compressing ion-beam ion shutter developed at The University of Arizona is composed of a series of electrically charged screens. By varying the relative voltages on the screens, the flow of ions into the detector chamber is blocked or opened. When the shutter is first opened, ions accumulate between the screens. When the shutter voltage is changed, the accumulated ions are compressed in space and the ion beam approaching the shutter is simultaneously closed. By controlling, (i) the relative voltages and the timing for changing voltage on each screen in the ion shutter, and (ii) the electrical gradient in the detector chamber, The University of Arizona researcher has achieved an increase in sensitivity with ion mobility spectrometers.","With the increase in attention to security concerns over past few years, ion mobility spectrometers have become popular devices for rapid detection and identification of airborne toxins, volatile organics, explosives, and other materials. However, a drawback to these devices is the sensitivity with which they can measure these compounds. The lack of sensitivity of ion mobility spectrometers can be attributed in part to the current shutter designs. An increase in the sensitivity can be realized through the use of the compressing ion-beam shutters described in this invention.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Novel mRNA-based Prognostic Index Derived from Differential Expression Analysis Improves Overall Survival Estimates in Glioblastoma,This innovation is a set of biomarkers to predict radiotherapy and chemotherapy outcomes in individual Glioblastoma Multiforme patients to better assess their prognosis and therapy. The method uses gene expression analysis to analyze multiple predictive biomarkers and generate a novel Glioblastoma Prognosis Index to accurately predict the overall survival of the afflicted patient. It can also potentially be used to predict patient responses to drugs that inhibit Wnt signaling pathway.,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer and is currently treated through surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

Bioimpedance System for Enhanced Positional Guidance,This technology is a biopsy system utilizing bioimpedance guidance to overcome limitations of current needles used in biopsy procedures. The research also provides bioimpedance based electrical control of bleeding complications.,"According to statistics published by the World Health Organization, cancer has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The global incidence of cancer in 2012 was 14.1 million and it is awaited to rise by 70.0% over the next two decades. Biopsy devices are used to collect samples from human patients. Guidance of needles is required in maximizing efficacy of, and minimizing complications of percutaneous procedures to get specific tissues. While the current standard of external imaging-based guidance (through x-rays/fluoroscopically/CT, medical ultrasound, or MRI) is very powerful, there are limitations.

Patients undergoing lung biopsy are often instructed to hold their breath while a CT scan is performed to determine if the trajectory of the needle is in line with the target lesion. However, many patients cannot reasonably hold their breath for the duration of the scan, let alone the brief time for interpretation of the scan including triangulating the trajectory of the needle and the target and then the time it takes for appropriate advancement of the needle to the target. During this interval from scan to needle advancement to the target, the needle tip moves with respirations and lung movement.

This technology aims to overcome the limitations to external guidance of needles with use of the electrodes to determine if the needle is heading in the right direction. The technology also provides bioimpedance-based electrical control of bleeding complications.",Life Sciences
Carpal Arch Space Augmentation (CASA5.0),"­This device is a non-invasive method for treating Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). By using radioulnar compression applied to the wrist and forearm, this approach precludes the need for surgery. This biomechanical technology allows patients to pursue a safer solution, with a short recovery period.","Currently only 23% of those who have suffered from CTS are able to return to their old profession after surgery, according to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Many patients may go through multiple surgeries, which can result in complications such as excessive scar tissue overgrowth and possibly leaving fingers devoid of sensation and without mobility.

This new device helps rehabilitate those with CTS without having to undergo surgery. A device that sits on the wrist and applies pressure to the radioulnar area of the forearm. Having proven that the methodology increases median nerve mobility over a relatively short treatment period, it helps patients recover without having to go through an expensive procedure. The CASA5.0 provides more flexibility and does not cause any permanent damage; because of this it can be used multiple times by those who have a chronic CTS condition.

Those suffering from CTS have limited non-surgical options for treatment, and those that do exist require an early diagnosis. Beyond the basic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, patients can receive injections of corticosteroids which helps relieve swelling and pressure on the nerve. There are also alternative therapies and lifestyle remedies that attempt to manage the symptoms and provide temporary relief. These treatments are for relatively mild symptoms, yet the carpal tunnel wrist surgical procedure is still the second most common surgery in America; sometimes even the surgery is not enough and risks worsening symptoms.",Medical Devices
A Device for Simultaneous Measurement of Pulmonary Ventilation and Metabolic Rate in Neonatal Rodents,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a way of measuring and studying neonatal rodents' breathing activity and metabolic rate simultaneously using this homemade dual chamber technology. This inexpensive and simple tool is also useful for comparing the ventilatory and metabolic responses to various stressors, including hypoxia, acute inflammatory episodes, heat and cold stress, air pollutants, maternal separation, and more in control and test subjects.","Pulmonary ventilation testing in small rodents can be very expensive and technically difficult. Moreover, the rate of lung ventilation depends primarily on the whole-body metabolic rate. This device provides an inexpensive approach for assessing both variables simultaneously in neonatal rodents using a dual-chamber plethysmograph.",Research Tools
HVAC Prediction Software for a Cost-Limited Home Thermostat,"Today's HVAC and thermostat systems are highly programmable, allowing homeowners to set different temperatures depending on the time of day. However, these systems do not take in to account how those changes are affecting your heating and cooling bill. This technology has the benefits of standard programmable thermostats while also providing homeowners with the ability to help heat and cool their home depending on their current budget.","Today's HVAC and thermostat systems are highly programmable, allowing homeowners to set different temperatures depending on the time of day.

This technology has the benefits of standard programmable thermostats while also providing homeowners with the ability to help heat and cool their home depending on their current budget.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
HVAC Prediction for a Cost-Limited Home Thermostat,"This technology addresses this problem by introducing a new cost-limited thermostat which provides real-time feedback on temperature-cost correlation and puts consumers in control of balancing their comfort and budget. When the temperature schedule or monthly budget is changed, the thermostat immediately displays how one affects the other allowing the user to always be in control of their thermostat and their budget.","Most homeowners would like to spend less on their air-conditioning and heating bills during the extreme heat of summer, and extreme cool of winter. Trivially, homes can spend $0 on heating and cooling by fully disabling their temperature control units; however, this may lead to discomfort. On the other hand, arbitrarily selected comfort levels may result in high costs to the homeowner which are not discovered until the previous month's electricity bill arrives. What is nontrivial is the ability to plan to spend a fixed amount (or an amount within an accepted tolerance) on the temperature of a building each month.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Mode Scrambler for Increasing Numerical Aperture,"This project is one of the three improvements to a falloposcope under development described in UA19-249. This falloposcope was designed with optical elements selected for detection of early stage ovarian cancer in fallopian tube epithelium. The mode scrambler improvement in this project acts to widen and brighten the illumination profile to better serve imaging the fallopian tube lumen. This is particularly important at the farther ends of the tubes, where the tubes branch into fingers. Cancer research has focused on the transfer of pre-cancerous lesions from the fallopian tube epithelium to the ovary surface at this interface.","Although rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late. Pelvic ultrasounds and the CA-125 blood test are generally accurate for detecting late stage III-IV ovarian cancer, but the survival rates are less than 30%, compared with &gt; 90% survival rates for cancer detected in early stages, I-II. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better early detection screening procedures, particularly for high risk women with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. A reliable early detection procedure would provide an option other than removal of all reproductive organs after 40 for high risk women. Current research includes examining early stage lesions on the surface of ovaries and fallopian tube epithelium. Access to the fallopian tubes through the cervix is an attractive option because it does not involve surgery; instead, falloposcopic examination can be done in a clinic with mild sedation. However, to be effective, a falloposcope must be small enough to pass through the narrow 1mm opening from the uterus to the proximal portion of the fallopian tube but it must have sufficient resolution and field of view to image the 4cm wide fimbral portion of the tube approximately 10cm away.
 
Other companies using fiber optics have employed similar methods for achieving changed illumination profiles though not in the field of endoscopic examination of the fallopian tubes for early cancer screening.",Imaging & Optics
Virtual Reality Systems and Methods for Improving Clinical Outcomes,"The invention provides a virtual reality (VR) experience, including VR goggles and haptic feedback devices, for patients to explain the benefits of a medical treatment or the consequences of non-compliance.

Experimental Method for Achieving Classical Entanglement in Large Multi-Qubit Acoustic Analogue Systems (Large Multi Phi-bit Systems),"The invention is an experimental scalable multi phi-bit system using classical entanglement which can be used to enhance quantum computing. The method here exploits the non-linearity of the quantum computing systems to create logical phibits. The number of phibits is not constrained by the domains of the physical state and the approach here also allows for the definition of the space of states which lie the elastic states of multi phibit systems. Because of the lack of physical constraints, the size of space of states is 2^N where N is the number of phibits, which corresponds to an exponential scaling. This level of exponential scaling is vital to the implementation of quantum computing style algorithms.","Quantum computing is a growing field due to the potential for quantum computers to solve complex computations substantially faster than a regular computer. The field is also increasingly relevant as it shifts towards real world use due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry and around data security, among other uses. A major hurdle in the use of quantum computing is the expensive requirements of use. Along with physical obstacles such as the ultralow temperature quantum computers run at, they are often not scalable due to physical limitations which do not allow for an increase of qubits.

The invention here is a method that will allowed for a scalable multi phi-bit system, which will allow users to avoid many of the expensive requirements of quantum computing systems. By taking advantage of phi-bits, which is a two-level classical analogue of the qubit, the method here is not constrained by physical limitations on the number of phi-bits as the phi-bits are differentiated in the spectral domain. This can allow for the phi-bit states to scale at an exponential level. As a result, this method avoids many of the expensive requirements of quantum systems, including extremely low temperature operation, short computation times, and scalability.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Method for Tailings Dust Suppression,"This technology is a new type of treatment that can be sprayed on mine tailings piles to suppress tailing dust from blowing off the pile, thereby preventing erosion and environmental contamination.","Tailings are the waste byproduct of ore mining, and consist of fine particles, many the size of dust particles. They are typically placed in large piles or pools for storage and, where possible, eventually reused or reclaimed. However, when tailings sit in a dry, untreated state, many of the smallest particles can be blown away by the wind. This presents an environmental danger, such as the potential for heavy metal dust to contaminate water sources.

To prevent tailing dust erosion, people spray a fluid over the surface of the pile that provides a protective, erosion-resistant barrier against the wind. Existing solutions are made of expensive synthetic materials. This technology, on the other hand, is made of inexpensive organic matter and will benignly break down on its own once the tailing pile is removed.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
"In-line Analytical Measurements for High-Throughput Manufacturing of Solar Cells, Enhancing Scalability of Next Generation Semiconductor Thin Film Stacks","A “stick and peel” removable electrochemical probe is used for solvent-free characterization of semiconductor films or optoelectronic devices and configured for use <em>in situ </em>and/or <em>in operando</em>. The invention may be used to analyze electronic materials such as a metal halide perovskite, an organic semiconductor, a nanocrystalline (quantum dot) thin film, metal oxides, a material blend or a device stack. The method may be used to analyze numerous characteristics, such as numbers of defects or defect density, stability, surface composition, band gap, physical structure, electroactivity, band bending, migration/diffusion process, and charging effects. This probe technology can be used in the manufacturing or analysis of thin film stacks to improve their performance and robustness.","At present, the connection between the fundamental research to tailor and control chemical processes and the engineering of materials manufacturing is complicated, which often means performance of electronic materials or devices is less than desired. Some of the key shortcomings in conventional manufacturing processes of electronic devices or semiconductor films include, but are not limited to, <em>in situ</em> characterization (observe processes under conditions that replicate real-world and real-time conditions) and <em>operando</em> characterization (direct visualization and characterization of processes in real time under applied electric fields and flux conditions). Such methods that allow <em>in situ</em> and/or <em>operando </em>characterization of electronic devices and/or semiconductor materials during manufacturing and/or operation, respectively, will promote stronger ties between basic and applied research, and enhance rates of commercialization of viable technologies based on these optoelectronic materials. Besides knowledge, these techniques are essential analytical tools that can follow chemical reactions, physical processes, microstructural changes, and interfacial phenomena in real-world conditions.

For the high-throughput production of (opto)electronic devices (ex. solar cells), state-of-the-art multi-model characterization capabilities, as well as novel inline sensors, are needed to follow (electro)chemical (e.g., intermolecular interactions, interfacial processes, defects, etc.) and/or physical (drying, crystal formation, surface tension, etc.) processes during the roll-to-roll, blade coating, slot-die, ink-jet, and/or various forms of spray printing, manufacturing operation across length and time scales, or to understand device–transport layer interactions.

To date, progress <em>in operando</em> and <em>in situ</em> characterization capabilities for the inspection of manufacturing lines for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells based on organic semiconductors or organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites has been demonstrated using optical approaches, such as ellipsometry, absorbance/reflection/transmission, and/or (time-resolved) photoluminescence ((TR)PL) testing or incorporating processing with x-ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Unfortunately, there are many questions still not answered using these methods.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Optimized Ore Processing using Molten Salts for Leaching and Thermal Energy Storage,"University of Arizona researchers have developed and optimized an electrochemical metal extraction process utilizing molten chloride salt. The salt serves as a heat transfer fluid, which can power the process itself or provide power to outside processing units or communities. The material, or slag, leftover from the process is non-toxic and may easily serve as a viable construction material.","The Copper, Zinc, and Lead refining industry is defined by its processes including smelting, leaching, electrolytic refining and more.

High Dimensional Structure-Activity Relationship Approach in Cell-Based Screening for Drug Effects in Intestine,This technology is a high throughput assay utilizing 3D cell culture and multiplex antibody staining techniques to study features of the intestine under various conditions. This technology can be utilized to screen drugs for intestine-related diseases and/or examine drugs for gut toxicity. A complimentary software is then used to measure and analyze these characteristics. A major advantage of this invention is that measurements are taken at single cell level so that subgroups of cells can be formed and more accurate information on these subgroups can be obtained.,"Cell-based assays have been a key component in the drug development process. They have been used to test the cytotoxicity, biological activity, biochemical mechanisms and off-target interactions of potential compounds. They are easily amenable to high-throughput screening to test many compounds under different conditions in parallel. Higher complexity organoid cultures of various cancer cells have been developed for drug screening. These spheroids show gene expression profiles that are closer to clinical profiles than traditional cell line cultures. In addition, a top reason why a drug may fail in clinical trials is that they induce potent gut toxicity. Therefore, a high-throughput cell assay using organoids grown from intestine cells would be quite attractive to pharma industry.",Software & Information Technology
Variance of Fixed Joint Space Width and Nomogram to Predict Knee Replacement using Measures from Fixed Flexion Knee X-rays,"The cartilage underneath our knees keeps the bones in our legs from rubbing together. Unfortunately for many, this cartilage wears abnormally thin over time and causes physiological problems. If, however, this can be detected before it becomes a serious issue for the patient, then the patient can receive treatments before the painful problem can be fully realized.","Current measurement methods are unreliable as they use minimum joint space width (mJSW) technology to take crude physical measurements (width, length) to make the assessment.

Natural Rubber Vulcanization using Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers,"Methods of vulcanization using a high content sulfur polymer, instead of elemental sulfur, have been developed for tire rubber production. The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking.  Furthermore, this technology suppresses ""reversion,"" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.","Vulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency,  vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.",Materials
"Low-Power, Compact Artificial Seismic Source","This technology is a system to create a shock impulse on the ground. It operates through a gear-motor that rotates a crank which lifts a linear slider. The slider is mounted in a massive body hammer that compresses a concentric spring on the slider shaft when the gear-motor rotates the crank. This causes the crank to rotate freely and the hammer to drop, creating a shock impulse into a strike plate. The use of a one-way bearing prevents any kind of bounce back and chatter in the impulse signal.","This proposed technology fills the need to create an active seismic source on interplanetary landing spacecraft for the characterization of lunar and planetary geology. Natural seismic events are unpredictable both in terms of timing and content. Thus, an artificial signal created on demand and with a known seismic signal content is strongly desired. However, many terrestrial analogs require ordnance or are very heavy and require large power draw. This technology features a compact, lightweight design that relies on low power consumption, which as a result is much more desirable for spacecraft which have extremely limited resources for mass and energy.

The global space economy is expected to grow by more than $700 billion in the next 20 years, and with new technologies come more possibilities. Spacecraft are projected to see a CAGR greater than 8%. The proposed technology will work great when attached to spacecraft and with the demand and market growing, it opens up the possibilities of adding this technology to future spacecraft",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Myofilament Based Therapeutics for Cardiac Muscle Arrhythmias and Skeletal Muscle Tremors,This invention describes a novel therapeutic approach to treat cardiac muscle arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors.,"Cardiac arrhythmias, such as those that cause atrial fibrillation or sudden cardiac death (SCD), are typically viewed as electrical/conduction abnormalities that drive uncoordinated heartbeats and their downstream health effects. Accordingly, most antiarrhythmic drugs are ion channel blockers that alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways. These drugs alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways by affecting so called ""excitation-contraction"" coupling where electrical/chemical signaling occurs upstream of, and thus prior to, muscle contraction.

The inventors have proposed a novel therapeutic that works downstream of these conventional drug targets: treating cardiac and skeletal contractile units, known as sarcomeres, with myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, they assert that this approach can modulate intrinsic wavelike oscillations of the sarcomeres, and would therefore be a novel antiarrhythmic and antitremor therapeutic approach. This is based on discoveries that have shifted the notion that cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors nearly always result from dysfunction of the upstream electrical/chemical signaling.",Life Sciences
Demultiplex Single-Cell Sequencing Data using DNA Barcode Dyes,"This technology applies to single cell RNA sequencing data that is created in parallel (multiplexed) to speed the process. Once the multiplexed data exists, it needs to be recombined into one set (demultiplexed) to be useful. This technology is a new demultiplexing technique that uses dyes combined with DNA barcodes, simplifying the demultiplexing process.","RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a next-generation sequencing technique that is used to detect and analyze RNA molecules to understand how a cell works. Compared to older techniques, it is faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective. The technique is useful in a variety of applications, including research into gene expression, discovery of new genes, and research into diseases, especially cancer.

State-of-the-art RNA-seq technology enables high throughput analysis by multiplexing techniques. In the end, the information needs to be recombined. There are a variety of existing demultiplexing techniques, but this one further streamlines existing techniques, making use of dyes combined with DNA barcodes to demultiplex the information at a reduced cost and without the need for as many reagents as existing techniques.",Research Tools
Copter-Based Configurable UAV,"This technology is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) consisting of multiple, interconnected quadcopters, which can fly in custom formations to optimize the control of the vehicle and recover from partial failures. The design allows for on-the-fly reconfiguration of the UAV, enabling robust operation in adverse weather conditions and changing shape to meet physical constraints. Furthermore, this new UAV benefits from redundant power, generated by multiple integrated quadcopters, to advance the resilience of aerial operations against failure and to improve the safety recovery capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles.","Rotor-based UAVs have significant advantages over traditional wing-based aircraft. They can take off and land without the need for a runway, and they can be made lightweight, agile, and able to hover and fit into small spaces. However, they have drawbacks. When rotors fail, the vehicle is less likely to be able to recover, and may crash. Furthermore, they have limited ability to handle bad weather, such as high winds.

This technology fixes this, creating a novel design that can adapt to failures, unexpected weather conditions, or tight spaces in real time.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Direct Capture and Smartphone Quantification of Airborne SARS-CoV-2 on a Paper Microfluidic Chip,"This is a rapid, handheld smartphone-based paper microfluidic assay that is capable of directly detecting SARS-CoV-2 in small droplets from the air, without the need for an air sampler or a long collection time. The infected droplets are collected on a paper microfluidic chip, which then has antibody-conjugated submicron fluorescent particle suspension added, with the antibody binding to the SARS antigens and aggregation. A smartphone-based fluorescent microscope is then used to quantify the extent of the particle aggregation to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This method can be applied to other airborne viruses.","The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, became a global pandemic in early March of 2020. Since then, the virus has infected more than 180 million people worldwide and has killed nearly 4 million. Although there are now vaccines to inoculate against the virus, only 23.2% of the world population has received a vaccine, and the vaccine is not 100% effective in protecting against the disease. Therefore, it remains imperative to be able to rapidly detect the virus when someone becomes infected, so that they can seek medical treatment and avoid spreading it to others.

While many COVID-19 diagnostics exist, many are unreliable or take many days to receive results. Furthermore, most COVID-19 tests cause discomfort for the individual being tested, deterring some from receiving the test. This technology instead can detect SARS-CoV-2 through small saliva droplets from an infected individual using a small microfluidic chip and a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope technology. The total assay time for this detection process is less than 30 minutes and is able to detect the virus from even small traces of the contaminated saliva. This is a low-cost and effective diagnostic method that has the potential to be applied to other airborne viruses.",Life Sciences
Variable-Pressure Head-Out Plethysmography Chamber with Data Acquisition and Analysis Software,"Animal studies have always been a large part of scientific and medical discoveries both for the animals being studied and for eventual human application. Plethysmography, studying the changes in the volume of a body or organ, is a critical part of those studies. Here specifically is the study of respiration endpoints in mice and rats given different environmental conditions including the introduction of aerosolized medication. Typically, there are two ways mice and rats have been studied: conscious or unconscious. Administering anesthesia is tricky and it does not accurately reflect the conscious reactions sometimes sought after in the research. However, conscious plethysmography offers its own set of problems. Scientists are trying to record accurate data while simultaneously keeping the mice under as little stress possible.","Conscious, restrained plethysmography during research on rodents can be difficult to achieve accurate results in terms of keeping accurate pressure, temperature, and humidity in the chamber or chambers. Much of that has to do with the restraint on the rodent’s head. While most head-out chambers offer a few different sizes, each mouse head is shaped slightly differently which just means that there are some gaps for air to escape.

This technology allows one to measure the respiratory rate, lung capacity, etc. for any sized rodent by sealing the chamber encapsulating the rodent’s abdomen away from the rodent’s head. This simple solution allows for more flexibility in experimental design, less stress on the rodent yielding more accurate results, and eliminating the need for additional sensors and cumbersome solutions to the pressure, temperature, and air leak.",Research Tools

Specific 17-Beta-Hydroxywithanolides Sensitize Cancer Cells to Apoptosis in Response to Toll-like Receptor (TLR),"This invention describes the use of physachenolide C for cancer treatment through cancer cell apoptosis (cell self-destruction) through extrinsic pathways of “death ligand” proteins. Physachenolide C is a natural product in which the 17-beta-hydroxy group and orientation of the molecule chain result in improved apoptosis sensitivity, with demonstrated 4-10x potency. Additionally, these compounds could also sensitize apoptosis in response to synthetic polynucleotides, which are thought to mimic anti-viral responses by activating toll-like receptor signaling.","Traditional treatment for various apoptosis-resistant cancers can be expensive and toxic, causing a range of adverse and difficult side-effects. This has caused a significant demand for new types of cancer treatments that can target resistant cancer cells. Market growth for cancer immunotherapy is strong with rising R&amp;D in a number of advantaged techniques. 
 
Physachenolide C has shown promising results over other compounds like withaferin A because the shape of the 17-beta hydroxy group and orientation of the lactone side chain appear crucial for the creation of proteins to selectively kill cancer cells. These compounds also appear to respond to synthetic polynucleotides to mimic anti-viral responses like toll-like receptors that recognize certain damage-associated molecular patterns, and this is of interest to immunologists.

The probe is also designed such that it could be implemented through the working channel of standard gastroscopes for human patients.","​​​​​​​This invention is primarily designed to help improve research and assessment of human cancers in animal models. Historically, examining progression of cancer in animal models for the purposes of cancer research required euthanasia to access the tissue.

Small Molecule Mixed Agonist/Antagonist for Opioid Receptors for Anti-Addiction and/or Pain Therapy,"This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mixture of an opioid receptor agonist in combination with an adrenoreceptor modulator compound.  The opioid receptor agonist may be a clinically-used drug, and the adrenoreceptor modulator compound is a novel small molecule.  ­Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown analgesic effect without reward behavior.","Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients’ quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear.  However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids.

Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part due to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs.",Healthcare Portfolios
Surface-Modified Electrospray Needles for Mass Spectrometry,"With this invention, electrospray needles used in mass spectrometry are coated to prevent sticking and clogging of analytes, resulting in improved mass detection sensitivity and consistency of analysis. The coating comprises an organic material covalently bonded to an interior surface of the electrospray needle.  The coating is electrically non-conductive and non-ionizable.","Mass spectrometry (MS) analyses are used in many applications, including in the development of pharmaceuticals, detection of proteins, viruses, or biomarkers in blood, and trace gas analysis.  In MS, samples are ionized and delivered to the spectrometer. The method of nano-electrospray ionization, which uses a tiny needle, are to known to have challenges with durability and consistency of results for analytes such as biomolecules due to a tendency to adhere to the inner walls of the needle, resulting in measurement variability.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
SmartPrint Polymer Material and Design for the Connection of Separate Optical Chips,"This technology is a further development of interconnect polymer waveguides for photonics packaging and integration. Here, a flexible optical substrate is attached and aligned to individual photonic chip components to form an optical waveguide.  The waveguide comprises a refractive index contrast (RIC) polymer directly patterned using a photolithography process.  The new advance is an optical interconnect for connecting two separate photonic integrated circuit chips (chip-to-chip) as well as coupling.  The refractive index contrast (RIC) polymers are suited to a wide variety of photonic interconnect applications for optical telecommunications with refractive and tunable indices. RIC polymer interconnects thus have the ability to access numerous photonic platforms, in particular silicon photonic chips and ion-exchange (IOX) glass optical substrates.","Since the end of clock frequency scaling of microprocessors in the mid-2000s, the microelectronics and communications industries have embraced parallelism to sustain performance improvement. Increasingly, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes, but by data movement between nodes, the interconnect. This is driving the increased consideration and deployment of optical interconnects, which do not suffer from the bandwidth limitations of their electrical counterparts as most dramatically born out in the tremendous growth of the Internet. A parallel, low loss and inexpensive optical interconnect solution is a highly desirable technology for furthering the growth of the cloud infrastructure, which increasingly involves data center photonics and the basic concept of co-packaged optics.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Novel Compounds Inhibiting COVID-19 Replication,"This technology is three potential pharmacological treatment options for COVID-19. The inventors identified three compounds, two naturally occurring and one small-molecule. These compounds target and inhibit the main 3CL protease that is essential to the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and have been shown to be effective against the virus in vitro.","In March of 2020, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, became a global pandemic and since then has infected more than 92 million people worldwide, killing nearly 2 million of those people. Even over a year since the first SARS-CoV-2 was reported, there are still very few treatment options available to counteract the negative effects of the viral infection. Although COVID-19 vaccinations are beginning to be widely distributed, the U.S. is still far from reaching herd immunity and many countries around the world still do not have access to the vaccine. In fact, in countries like India, where vaccine supply is low, there have been recent surges in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2.
This technology provides three potential pharmacological treatment options for COVID-19 that have been demonstrated as effective to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, making this treatment a potential method to stop the spread of COVID-19 and end the global pandemic that has now stretched over one year.",Life Sciences
Sensor Array for Biomarker Degradation Measurement,"This invention is an electronic sensor that is modified with a recognition element. This element is modified so it may be used to capture specific molecules from non-invasive biological fluids. These fluids include sweat, saliva, and tears. These biomarkers will react to enzymes which can be used in new products to provide quantitative information related to health and well-being of patients.","Wearable biochemical sensors are increasing in use due to their ability to personalize medicine and continuously monitor human health. Therefore, significant research and funding has been put towards developing sensors that enable real-time and non-invasive structure that are able to receive and measure various chemical constitutes in the human body. These include sweat, saliva, and tears. What has assisted increased investigation and funding towards wearable biochemical sensors has been the advances in material science and mechanical engineering. These complementary advances have assisted with providing various biomarkers.

Collection of sweat, a biofluid, is of extreme interest due to easy, non-invasive collection and rich content of important biomarkers. These include electrolytes, small molecules, and proteins. Establishing sweat monitoring techniques using simple fabric switching are limited to basic analysis in a controlled laboratory or hospital setting. Therefore, there is a need to develop a wearable device that can collect sweat, as a biological fluid and biomarker, so it may react with an enzyme to further understand patient health and well-being.

Photocatalytic Alpha Arylation of Carbonyls,"This invention is a method for the synthesis of alpha arylation of inexpensive, unactivated carbonyl compounds with high yields at room temperature using any photocatalyst (PC) under visible light from blue to red.","Functionalization of the C-H bond has evolved as a fundamental principle that underpins both academic and industrial importance in conceptualization and actualization of challenging organic transformations. This ubiquitous but relatively inert bond, if converted to more valuable C-C bond, can greatly accelerate the construction of a wide variety of compounds.  This transformation is particularly sought after in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical applications. Incorporation of an aryl substituents at the α-position of carbonyl compounds is a powerful and attractive method to construct a C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond; and its coupling products, especially α-aryl cyclic ketones are significant structural motifs that are often encountered in a wide range of biologically interesting natural and pharmaceutical products. A number of classical stoichiometric transformations have been employed for such a key transformation but suffered from complications in scale-up, either due to the need to use highly activated aryl halides as reactants or the use of stoichiometric amount of toxic reagents with harsh reaction conditions, e.g., a high reaction temperature. Significant efforts have been directed towards the development of alternative synthetic routes to this important scaffold. With the advances in metal-catalyzed transformations, palladium-catalyzed α-arylations of the carbonyl compounds appeared to be the most promising route due to its versatility. However, high cost of the catalyst and additives, as well as requiring a high reaction temperature limits the utility of this approach in the synthesis of α-aryl carbonyls as building block, especially for pharmaceutical applications.",Materials
Novel Antibiotic Drug Combination Including an Anti-Inflammatory Metabolite,"This technology involves a combination of a metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthanilic acid (3HAA) with a compound that alters cellular iron homeostasis (e.g. an iron chelator or an iron supplement) that produces synergistic antibiotic interaction.  3HAA sensitizes bacteria to changes in iron availability (both increasing iron media content through supplementation or chelation of iron). Iron is an important element that is necessary for many critical processes in biological systems, including both eukaryotic cells and bacteria. Iron chelators act by binding available iron, making it easier for cells and tissues to move and excrete. Combining 3HAA with an iron supplement or an iron chelator indicates dual benefit of killing and inhibiting growth of pathogenic bacteria while repressing hyperinflammatory response.","Antibiotic resistance is one of the most prominent problems in healthcare today. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States alone sees more than 2.8 million cases of antibiotic-resistant infection each year resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. Sepsis-dysfunctional systemic inflammatory response to infection leading to organ damage and failure-is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and among the most expensive health conditions treated in the United States. Sepsis survivors experience chronic inflammation, immune suppression, reduced physical function, elevated frailty, and higher mortality rates. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance has left healthcare workers with a depleted toolbox to combat sepsis. Age is both a primary risk factor for developing sepsis and a major determinant of survival and long-term consequences. There is an urgent and growing need to identify novel antibiotics to combat both the general expansion of antibiotic-resistance bacterial pathogens and sepsis-particularly in elderly patients.

To solve this problem, there is a need to develop new types of bacteria-resistant antibiotics. This technology promises to help meet that need, adding one additional tool for medical practitioners to use against antibiotic-resistant infections. In addition, it can be used to reduce inflammation in people with sepsis, which can reduce the chance of organ failure and improve recovery and survivability.",Healthcare Portfolios
Green-Enhancer Glasses,"This invention is an optical filter which blocks out blue light and only allows green to pass through, increasing the relative amount of green light that passes through. This filter can be used on prescription and non-prescription glasses, as well as on coverings for lamps and light bulbs. Green light in the morning can rehabilitate the circadian system of aging adults leading to a healthier lifestyle.","Research into how exposure to various types of light affects the human body has increased recently. The result of studies has led to the conclusion that exposure to green light in the morning can rehabilitate the circadian system of aging adults and lead to a healthier sleep schedule. By strengthening the circadian system, aging adults can lead a healthier life than they otherwise would have been able to.
This invention is a filter which blocks out blue areas of light and only allows green light to pass through which increases the relative amount of green light that passes through. When worn in the morning, aging adults can enjoy all the benefits of green light exposure, which include strengthening the body’s circadian system, leading to a better sleep schedule and thus a healthier lifestyle. The invention can be places on prescription and non-prescription glasses, along with coverings for lamps and light bulbs.",Imaging & Optics
Melanopsin Blocker,This invention describes an optical filter that can be used in the production of glasses that block wavelengths of light harmful to circadian rhythms and sleep.,"The great importance of maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm and getting good sleep continues to be firmly supported by researchers, and more healthy sleep is known to produce better health outcomes compared to those who consistently get poor sleep. Currently, the market standard glasses do not protect the wearers from an increasing threat: bad sleep caused by wavelengths of light from 455-495nm (known as blue, or circadian-active light) emitted from screens. These wavelengths of light activate the circadian system to suppress melatonin, the hormone associated with sleep.

The inventors have developed an optical filter that blocks these circadian-active wavelengths of light and could be used on both prescription and non-prescription glasses. These glasses could prove to be an effective way to curb bad sleep and its resulting bad health outcomes for those who are around screens or light before bedtime.",Healthcare Portfolios
Multispectral Cancer Imaging Instrument,This skin cancer detection invention works by illuminating the area in question and imaging it in several different spectral bands. The sampled bands are compared to a normal sample by a unique method. Normal and abnormal areas are then displayed in appropriate colors.,"The standard testing and removal procedure for skin cancer is called the Mohs technique. This entails taking a thin slice of skin from the top and staining it in order to analyze it under a microscope. This process can take multiple hours wasting time and giving anxiety to the patient as they wait for their results. 

This method and device would be completely non-invasive, and the medical technician would hold the camera with the LED light ring around the periphery of the lens, about 12-18 inches away from the patient. This method allows for the picture taken by the camera to be quickly transferred to a computer, where the patients skin can be quickly and accurately analyzed.",Imaging & Optics
Circadian Rhythm Restoring Blue Blockers,"This technology is for glasses that are to be worn at night to block harmful blue light from artificial light sources. Specifically, these glasses block wavelengths associated with circadian-active light, which causes melatonin suppression. This intervention restores the endogenous rhythms of users and leads to better sleep patterns.","With the prevalence of mobile phones, televisions, and other screens, humans are exposed to a great deal of blue light at night. This exposure leads to the suppression of melatonin, the hormone associated with sleep. This in turn affects the human circadian rhythm and leads to unhealthy sleep. It is estimated that the number of adults suffering from circadian rhythm sleep disorders could be as high as 10% and the number of adolescents suffering from these disorders may be as high as 16%. When untreated, sleep disorders can lead to problems with physical, psychological, and social health.

These blue-light blocking glasses target harmful blue light as well as the wavelengths associated specifically with circadian-active light. Current similar models of blue blockers only block a small portion of circadian-active light, whereas these more completely and effectively block circadian-active light. These glasses are meant to be worn at night and have the capability of restoring the endogenous rhythms of users, which will lead to better sleep and a healthier lifestyle.",Healthcare Portfolios
Blue-Enhancer Glasses,"Because of the huge increase in the amount of blue light consumed by the average individual due to myriad factors including society’s dependence on phones, tablets, and computers, blue light blocking glasses are becoming commonplace. Not only do blue light suppressing glasses decrease some of the stress on an individuals’ eyes, but the decrease in blue light staves off another side effect of blue light consumption: a decrease in melatonin production. This invention performs the opposite function, increasing levels of blue light in the morning thereby staving off melatonin production, strengthening the circadian system, and leading to stronger, healthier circadian rhythms.","The idea that an individual’s mood and health are related to the amount of light exposure is not a new one; however, the medical industry’s understanding of its various wavelengths and uses has grown, and continues to grow in recent years.
In the past few decades especially, the industrialized world continues to try and squeeze more and more productivity out of a 24 hour period. Perhaps even more troubling is the increase in sleep disorders which, in some cases, are up 64% from 2013 to 2016. It seems that as individuals spend more time, especially at night, on screens or looking at blue light, the circadian rhythms have been substantially altered. This alteration makes melatonin production more difficult during the night/evening. So far, new products, research, and ideas tend to favor blocking blue light at night to increase melatonin production. However, the circadian rhythm is more affected at all times during the day which would lead to the conclusion that the few hours just after waking up are just as important as those few hours before going to sleep.",Healthcare Portfolios
Pink Blue Blockers,This invention uses pink lenses as an efficient way to block blue light while appealing to younger users and those who have a difficult time wearing the more visually cumbersome orange or red lenses. The use of blue light blocking glasses have recently become more popular for the general public because an increasing number of individuals spend a majority of their day looking at screens. The most effective lenses at blocking blue light—red and orange lenses—are difficult to wear and are not aesthetically appealing to younger users.,"Currently, most blue light blocking technology in glasses is manifest in four different colors: clear (to the extent clear is a color), yellow, orange, and red—the darker the color, the greater the ability of the lenses to block blue light. Orange and red are worn by users to promote healthy sleep habits. This is especially important because blue light suppresses the generation of melatonin. Therefore, the logic goes, the use of strong blue light suppression glasses allows the user two benefits: (1) Continuing use of devices that may be necessary for work or entertainment; and (2) Generating melatonin at normal levels and allowing for normal sleep patterns. Furthermore, blue light puts a great strain on the eyes of those who constantly look at blue light, which is no small percentage of the population.",Imaging & Optics
Interferometric System with Deep Learning Algorithm to Process Two Interferograms,This invention is an interferometric system that captures two interferograms and utilizes a deep learning algorithm to process two interferograms. This invention enables the measurement of surface roughness and surface shape using the interferometric system and neural network to process the data. The deep learning portion of the system is in a compact form allowing for on-machine measurements and a suitable attachment to the interferometric system.,"The application of high precision optical elements are vast, from smart-phone camera lenses, telescopes, in addition to optical fibers and much more. With an increase in technological development the needs for high precision optical elements, accurate and efficient fabrication process is highly demanded, placing ultrahigh requirement on the measurement tools to improve workpiece quality control and manage machining process. As a recognized accurate testing method, interferometry has been a powerful method for non-contact surface metrology of optical elements. There are two unique interferometry methods to measure surface form and roughness. Currently the commercial interferometric instruments have a separate procedure to acquire the surface form and roughness measurements. This adds additional costs, time, and fabrication errors to the interferometric process of measurements.",Imaging & Optics
Control of Probe Beam Duration in Single Wavelength Monitoring of Hologram Diffraction Efficiency,This technology is a novel technique for monitoring the diffraction efficiency of Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) in real time. The technique works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter. This technique has the potential for a higher accuracy calculation of the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs at a greater simplicity.,"Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) have many applications ranging from display systems, medical devices, and solar energy systems. An important characteristic of VHOEs is diffraction efficiency, which measures how much power is diffracted into a designated direction compared to the power incident onto the diffractive element. Most VHOEs much attain a certain diffraction efficiency; in many designs, the diffraction efficiency should be maximized while in others, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. The most common method of controlling the diffraction efficiency is to characterize the holographic material’s diffraction efficiency as a function of exposure energy by fabricating a set of holograms with different exposure energies and measuring the diffraction efficiency of each, with the hologram most closely matching the design constraint used to fabricate the desired VHOE. Another method uses additional equipment and complicated experimental setups to measure the diffraction efficiency by shining light from a separate laser at the construction wavelength from the VHOE. This technique, which works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter, can calculate the diffraction efficiency at a higher accuracy at a greater simplicity. The calculations are performed in real time, meaning the technique has the potential to account for local variations in the material or laser power that causes the necessary exposure time to fluctuate between samples, which allows for a more precise reading of the diffraction efficiency. This technique is particularly useful for VHOEs used in display systems where precise diffusion efficiency needs to be attained.",Imaging & Optics
Overlapping Apertures Diffractive Optical Lens,"This invention describes a diffractive optical lens that utilizes overlapping apertures for higher resolution images than conventional methods. The inventors have created a lens design, method of manufacturing, and an imaging instrument to utilize the lens that is based on overlapping apertures where a single coherent light illumination is used, and multiple images of the object are measured simultaneously, which can be used to construct a higher resolution image of the object. This has the potential to be superior in function and resolution in image capturing compared to the current standard.","In many optical applications such as handheld or smartphone cameras, multi-focal lenses, and flat lenses use a traditional method of object construction by measuring multiple images of the object under different coherent light illumination with specific measurements to reconstruct the resulting image.",Imaging & Optics
Super Resolution Lens Free Microscopy,This invention describes a design for a lens free microscope system that can achieve resolution significantly better than current technologies. The technology involves the use of a nanostructured mask to encode high resolution information about the object that would normally be lost due to diffraction.,"Lens free microscopes are advantageous in several ways including cost-effective hardware, compact and lightweight form factor, and high space-bandwidth product. Current lens free microscopy methods have limitations on resolution, as they have diffraction limits of one-half wavelength.

The inventors have developed a new and effective design that can achieve a super resolution lens free microscopy system with resolution significantly better than one-half wavelength. The inventors propose using a randomly nanostructured mask to help encode high resolution information about the object being imaged. This empowers lens free technology to have far more applications.",Imaging & Optics
Rapid In-Situ Metrology of a Heliostat Field Using Starlight,This technology is a means of rapidly measuring the optical properties of each heliostat in a heliostat field using starlight. It is ideal for use with heliostats that can have their shape actively changed to maximize their light concentration effectiveness as they track the sun over the course of the day.,"Heliostats are devices that track the sun over the course of a day, reflecting the sunlight to a stationary target. Large arrays of heliostats, or “heliostat fields,” can be used to concentrate and focus light on one location such as a spot at the top of a tower. The heat generated from the concentrated light can then be used to generate power or provide a heat source for industrial operations without generating a carbon footprint.
Heliostats require calibration to ensure they are reflecting and concentrating light as efficiently as possible. There are many different techniques to measure a heliostat’s properties for calibration; however, existing techniques tend to be slow, expensive, or imprecise. This technology is a new, fast, and precise method for measuring heliostat properties that uses observed starlight and can be used to calibrate an entire heliostat field in one night, avoiding interruptions of daytime operations.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Heralded-Multiplexed High-Efficiency Cascaded Source of Dual-Rail Polarization-Entangled Photon Pairs using Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion,"This technology is a high-efficiency, high-fidelity method of generating pairs of polarization-entangled photonic qubits. The use of a cascaded source that performs a linear-optical entanglement swap between two spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources, to generate a heralded photonic entangled state that has a higher fidelity compared to a free-running SPDC source.","Quantum bits, or qubits, are basic units of quantum information that can be used to store or transmit information just like the classical bit used in traditional computing. They are the fundamental component that enables quantum computers and quantum communication. Entangled qubits are qubits which, regardless of their physical distance, will demonstrate correlated states, over any distance and even when the state of one qubit is changed. This is a fundamental building block of quantum computing and quantum communication.
This technology creates entangled qubits from light particles (photons). There are multiple state-of-the art methods of entangled photonic qubit generation, but they generally suffer from a degree of “noise” in the entanglement state, where the state observed in one entangled qubit will not always equal the state of the other qubit. This technology serves to address this problem, resulting in much higher, near deterministic levels of correlation between two entangled qubits.",Imaging & Optics

Birefringent Coating to Remove Polarization Dependent Phase Shift,"This technology is a method designed to remove unwanted phase shifts from optical instruments to improve their performance. The method involves the manufacture and application of a layer, or multiple layers, of birefringent materials (materials with two distinct refractive indices) such that the unwanted phase shift is removed from the optical instrument.","Optical interference filters have been around and known for a century, and these filters have been effectively exploited technologically for at least several decades. Additionally, birefringent materials have been, and continue to be used in optics to produce various results such as, producing polarizing prisms, interference colors, and retarder plates. Because of their unique properties, birefringent materials play a large role in optical systems.

This technology is more than simply using birefringent materials to reduce polarization aberration in an optical system. This is a method for determining the thickness and angle of a birefringent material to optimize the performance of an optical system by removing any phase shift in the system, what the authors call “parasitic retardance.”  The birefringent material can be applied to an interference filter, or be placed on a different substrate allowing for more customization by placing the birefringent material anywhere in the optical path.",Imaging & Optics

Metal Organic Frameworks for Scintillation Detection of Low Energy Radionuclides,"Scintillating metal-organic framework (MOF) particles provide enhanced and robust low-energy β emission sensing in aqueous systems. In addition to being stable and dispersive in aqueous solutions, the scintillating -MOFs are stable and functional in a wide range of organic and aqueous-organic systems and uniquely allow control of excitonic transport within the particle in order to avoid energy dissipation during exciton transfer, making it possible to achieve an ultrasensitive platform to sense β emitters in biological systems. The scintillating MOFs mesoporous nanostructures are composed of Zr or Hf metal clusters and organic luminescent linkers (L), such as poly aromatic compounds.","Low-energy beta (β) radioemitters (3H, 14C, 33P, 35S) can be quite useful as labels in biological research, but the sensing and quantifying of β emission is challenging given its characteristic low decay energy and short penetration depth in aqueous solutions.  Current proximity-based β emitter sensing options are often based on scintillating fluorophore-doped polymeric particles or yttrium silicate spheres, but intrinsic aqueous instabilities, chemical instability, and/or low efficiencies result in low sensitivity and limit their applicability in biological fields.",Materials
Stereospecific Synthesis of Rhamnolipids and their Sugar Analogues from Sustainable Sources by Chemical and Chemoenzymatic Pathway,"This technology is a method of synthesizing enantiomerically pure rhamnolipids without the need for a chromatographic separation, such synthesis using enzymatic processing.  The method may be used to create compounds with multiple, specific chiral centers.","Rhamnolipids are a type of chemical notable particularly for their surfactant properties. Unlike most traditional surfactants (such as soaps and detergents), rhamnolipids can be created through an environmentally friendly process, and the resultant chemical is generally less harmful than traditional surfactants.

This technology enables production of one specific enantiomer of a given rhamnolipid. Enantiomers have the same chemical formula, but are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, much like a person’s left and right hands. It is valuable to be able to produce specific enantiomers because, despite having the same chemical formula, two enantiomers can have different effects on living organisms.

Existing methods of producing enantiomerically pure rhamnolipids involve first creating a 50-50 mixture, and then separating out the desired molecules. This is an expensive and difficult process. This technology addresses this problem, resulting in an environmentally, cost effective, and scalable production process.",Materials
Rapid-Integrations for Conjunction Assessment (RICA),"Rapid-Integrations for Conjunction Assessment (RICA) is a tool for efficiently and accurately predicting close approaches between space objects close to or in orbit of Earth, for use in planning launch and placement of satellites in Earth orbit.","Space around Earth is becoming progressively more congested, especially in the Low Earth Orbit band. According to NASA, there are approximately 23,000 pieces of space junk larger than a softball orbiting Earth, and there are over 100 million pieces a millimeter or larger. These pieces of junk are moving at high speed and can severely damage a satellite or spacecraft they hit. A collision can even cause more debris to form, worsening the problem; in 2009, a defunct spacecraft collided with another craft, resulting in 2,300 new pieces of debris.
As more and more satellites are launched into orbit, the risk from space debris increases. Multiple companies are putting “mega constellations” of satellites into orbit, consisting of many thousands of small satellites. When designing these constellations, it is important to place them in orbits that minimize the risk of collisions. This technology helps solve this problem by providing an efficient and reliable means of predicting the chance of collisions with space debris and other satellites during design of a satellite constellation.",Software & Information Technology
Covid-19 Time of Intubation Mortality Evaluation (C-TIME),This invention describes software that uses a scoring system for calculating the probable mortality of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at the time they require mechanical ventilation.,"Worldwide there have been over 208 million cases of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and over 4.37 million of these cases resulted in death of the patient. In the United States alone there have been nearly 37 million cases of SARS-CoV-2. Although, as of August 2021, 51% of the population has been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, it is still imperative that treatments be available because rates of vaccine skepticism remain high. This leaves millions of people still unprotected from SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, with the delta variant in wide circulation and vaccination rates lagging, there are still many hospitalized patients who face the risk of being put on a ventilator (intubated) which vastly decreases their chances of mortality. This invention will help to determine the risk of mortality when patients are intubated.",Software & Information Technology
American Sign Language Gloss,"The invention, American Sign Language (ASL) Gloss is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to facilitate deaf students' learning of English literacy. ASL Gloss serves as a response to the age-old dilemma of how to teach deaf students how to read English effectively, without the use of audible sound.","In celebration of ASL Day 2019, Newsweek published the following statistics in relation to deaf users of ASL: 98% of deaf people do not receive education in sign language, 72% of families do not sign with their deaf children, 70% of deaf people don't work or are underemployed, and 1 in 4 deaf people has left a job due to discrimination.
There is a large demand for effective methods to teach deaf students how to become literate in English. ASL Gloss utilizes the fact that deaf students know and use a signed language, namely American Sign Language and their linguistic strength lies in tapping into their signed language knowledge for the purpose of becoming proficient readers in English as a second language.
The combination of ASL Gloss and other best practices followed by teachers will allow for students to complete their specific objectives and become English literate.",Creative Works
Novel High Refractive Index and Abbie Value Polymers for Advanced Lower Cost Optical Eyewear,"Copolymerization of chalcogenide halides with widely available unsaturated monomers is used to create advanced polymer materials for consumer plastic optics, consumer eye wear, and smart phone plastic optics.","Sulfenyl chlorides are a widely known but largely ignored class of sulfur compounds that are highly reactive toward nucleophiles and electrophilic unsaturated compounds.  Sulfenyl chlorides are closely related to organosulfur thiol and mercaptan molecules were the R-S-H bond is replaced via chlorination reactions to form the R-S-Cl, which is constitutes the sulfenyl chloride moiety.  The S-Cl functional group is dipolar covalent in nature and can be considered a strong electrophile for attack by nucleophilic compoudnds such as, alcohols/alkoxides, Grignard reagents, organolithium reagents to form various organodisulfide compounds.

The melanocortin receptor ligand is bound to an MC3R and/or MC4R selective moiety, which allows the complex to cross the blood brain barrier. The ligand-moiety complex has improved selectivity to MC3R and/or MC4R and anti-inflammation function.","MC3R and MC4R are under-targeted in treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, existing ligand analogues have low selectivity and anti-inflammation function relative to the present invention.",Life Sciences
Small Mine Activities Reporting Tool (SMART): A Mobile App to Improve Compliance Reporting and Track Outcomes,"This technology is a smartphone-based software platform to implement the mining health and safety reporting requirements overseen by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Small mining operators often face challenges implementing the requirements, and this software helps demystify the process. Developed with input from MSHA, state grants programs, and mine operators, the app helps ensure the proper tracking and reporting of hours worked, activity commencement and closure, and record-keeping for workplace accidents and injuries. It supports capture and storage of photos and videos as supplemental documentation, and provides a metrics dashboard with easy to understand visualizations.","Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) classifies roughly 50% of all mining operations as small. But existing environment, health, and safety (EHS) software solutions are often generalized rather than industry-specific, and are intended for large organizations with more resources to develop their programs. Small mine operators are often left in a situation where they lack the resources to track their documentation effectively, leading to violations, citations, and reduced overall worksite safety. This invention is intended to address the pain points experienced specifically by small mine operators, in a streamlined, lightweight, and easy to use package.",Software & Information Technology
"Apparatus for Adjustable Spectral Resolution, Self-Calibration, and Self-Stabilization of Smartphone Spectrometer","This technology allows for the ability to adjust spectral resolution and spectral range of a smartphone spectrometer through the use of a rotating grating wheel. It enables self-calibration and self-stabilization by coupling a source into the designed optical system.  Sources are the built-in smartphone flash, other sources built into the smartphone, or another source included in the optical system design.","Spectroscopy is a scientific measurement technique to study matter through its interaction with different components of the electromagnetic spectrum or through interactions with radiative energy as a function of its frequency or wavelength. Various spectroscopy techniques can be used in virtually every domain of scientific research, ranging from biomedical sciences to space exploration endeavors.
Many spectroscopy devices are large, costly, and cannot be conveniently transported. Further, many current devices are difficult to use. Therefore, this smartphone-based spectroscopy technology offers several advantages over traditional spectroscopy devices. The add-on apparatus to the smartphone can have widespread uses in clinical and field settings, allowing medical doctors, consumers, or scientists to purchase the add-on for a low-cost, while the smartphone platform provides simple ease of use.

Method to Rescue Light Sensitivity in Retinas after Photoreceptor Degeneration,This invention describes a method by which light sensitivity in the retina can be restored using gold nanoparticles after the photoreceptors have been degraded or damaged.,"Traditional treatment for visual impairment can differ based on the cause of the impairment, but often includes eyeglasses, contact lenses, Lasik surgery, or simple quality of life (QOL) aids such as service dogs or canes. In many cases, visual impairment or blindness is not fixed or repaired, but mitigated as long as possible. This has left a large demand for some technology or therapeutic that can actually help patients suffering from visual impairment to restore vision or light sensitivity.

In this technology, the inventors propose a method that utilizes gold nanoparticles to restore light sensitivity in the retina following photoreceptor damage or degradation. These gold nanoparticles are conjugated to specific cellular targets to initiate action potentials and restore light sensitivity.",Life Sciences

Ambient Dried Aerogels based on Alkyl Sulfide Bridged Polysilsesquioxanes,"Aerogel is a low-density solid material that is produced by removing the liquid component from a conventional gel. Ambient dried aerogels utilize calculated levels of temperature and pressure using certain chemicals to remove the liquids from the aerogel. This technology is a method of preparation of low density, porous aerogels without the use of supercritical temperatures and pressures from bridged polysilsesquioxane alcogels with dialkylsulfide, dialkyldisulfide, and dialkylpolysulfide bridging groups. These gels are prepared from bis (trialkoxysilyl) monomers which are dried by heating at ambient pressure over a period of days.","Aerogels are synthetic, porous materials that are derived from gels. Due to its solid state but low density, it is an ultralight material that can be used as a thermal insulator, desiccant, or even as a means of providing a waterproof coating. Aerogels are used for a variety of purposes from thickening agents to makeup and paint. After discontinued use in the 1970s, efforts began to develop a non-toxic, safer aerogel that was less hazardous and flammable. Aerogels have wide commercial applications in everything from wetsuits, skylights, windows, paints, cosmetics to nuclear weapons.
 
Currently, aerogels are dried by either using freeze or other supercritical methods. These methods are able to successfully dry the aerogels to their final state; however, there are some drawbacks. Both of those methods can be expensive and time consuming. This has led to a hindered growth in the market.  A cheaper and quicker drying method would help lead to mass commercialization of aerogels.",Materials
Applied Resuscitation Education & Specialized Training (AREST),"Our researchers have created a training outline called: Applied Resuscitation Education &amp; Specialized Training (AREST) programs, which have been designed to teach first responders how to care for patients with life- threatening medical problems. This innovative approach differentiates AREST from traditional programs by offering both online and in-person modalities and cost-effective pricing.","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, more commonly known as CPR, is a life-saving technique that helps maintain blood flow to the brain and heart in an emergency situation. In Western-developed countries, the probability of survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is only 6-10%.
This AREST software is designed to effectively teach resuscitation education and other lifesaving medical care information to groups with different levels of medical training.
This online learning module software will require in-person skills/training testing to receive accreditation. Studies have shown that online instruction alone can lead to overestimation of chest compression, indicating the benefit of in-person evaluation.",Healthcare Portfolios

PHOENIX: No-Code Development of Mobile Patient Companion Apps,"This technology is a development platform designed to facilitate the rapid creation of custom smartphone applets for self-management of a patient’s health. Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, individuals with no programming skills can easily and efficiently create custom interactive tutorials.","Patient Self-Management (PSM) apps are used to guide patients through self-management of their own medical conditions or general health and well-being via engaging content. For example, PSM apps may provide tracking, goal setting, or educational materials to help patients outside of the doctor’s office. These apps have been shown to be effective for managing various chronic conditions and are seeing increasing acceptance as a valuable tool by the medical community.

However, existing apps tend to focus narrowly on a single topic or condition, such as diabetes, asthma, pregnancy, nutrition, or fitness. Furthermore, they give general guidance that does not take into account special situations or comorbidities that may warrant custom tailored solutions for the individual. The Phoenix No-Code software solves this problem, by creating a platform that allows non-programmers to rapidly create and deploy custom interactions that are tailored to each individual patients needs.",Software & Information Technology
"A Microbiome Sparing, Organism-Specific Therapy for C. difficile Infection","University of Arizona researchers have developed a water-soluble nanocarrier that is non-toxic to both human tissue and to bacteria. The carrier can complex with oligonucleotides that can bind to bacterial mRNA, preventing translation and inhibiting various bacterial functions.","The carrier can complex with translation-inhibiting modified oligonucleotides of such length that specific species of bacteria can be targeted. This technology not only allows for species-specific killing of bacteria, but unlike all current antibiotics, it allows for inhibiting bacterial virulence factors such as toxin production and spore formulation, making this technology a major disruptor in the antibiotic space.
Since the patented carrier for this technology can allow oligonucleotide delivery to any bacteria, not just C. difficile, this technology can be used to treat any bacteria on any epithelial surface, such as gut, lung, and skin.",Life Sciences
Viral Vector for Developing Oral Vaccines and Therapeutics Against Diseases in Aquatic Animals,"This technology uses a genetically engineered replication deficient virus as a vector to deliver genes encoding vaccine (i.e. antigen) or therapeutic nucleic acid (e.g. RNAi molecules). The vaccine gene can be purified and used as an injectable vaccine in fin fish. In fin fish, the vaccine gene will express the antigen and immunize the vaccinated fish. In crustaceans, the therapeutic nucleic acid targets pathogenic viruses and enables the host to prevent clinical manifestation and disease development.","Infectious diseases caused by viruses are threats to growth and sustainability of aquaculture industry worldwide. In fact, periodic outbreak of diseases poses the biggest risk in the profitability and expansion of fish, shellfish and crustacean farming. Crowded culture environment also poses high risk for infection. While some vaccines are available for a few viral diseases in fin fish, conventional vaccination approach is not feasible in shellfish and crustaceans due to lack of adaptive immunity in invertebrates. Some infections can be cured using several FDA approved antibiotics and the other medicines.

Apart from diseases, medicines are used to improve the wellbeing of the fish in the aquaculture. Current treatment depends primarily on injections, which is costly and not feasible for shellfish and small fish species. The ability to deliver vaccine and therapeutic molecules via oral route, will open-up a new avenue in managing diseases in aquaculture species.",Agriculture & Horticulture

"ORACLE - A PHM Test & Validation Platform for Anomaly Detection in Biotic (e.g., Vital Sign) or Abiotic Sensor Data",This invention is a prognostics and health management (PHM) test and validation platform named ORACLE. The ORACLE emulates the occurrence of environmental changes and generates a log file to allow for training and subsequent deep learning-based anomaly detection frameworks for monitoring space habitat health. ORACLE uses multi-layer feedforward networks or other deep learning approaches to detect anomalies. The ultimate goal is to use the measured “biometric” changes in each crew member as a supplementary indicator to detect degradation in the space habitat environment and associated habitat subsystems.,"Space habitats must be autonomously operated due to the lack of a permanent occupancy and to constantly ensure the health and safety of individuals residing aboard. The general idea is to use the crew health status as an integrated contributor to other PHM capabilities already implemented on associated space habitat subsystems. The availability and compactness of ECG, blood oxygenation, ocular structure, and vision performance monitoring equipment – ranging from devices having a form-factor of a wristwatch to smartphone-based examination equipment – lend themselves to be ideal in environments where self-diagnostics and payload considerations are vital to mission success.",Imaging & Optics

Design of Intelligent Aeroponic Microgravity & Earth Nutrient Delivery System (I-AMENDS) for Bioregenerative Space Life Support and Earth Applications,"This technology allows for the growth of plants in zero-gravity or microgravity environments. The invention solves the problem of directing water and nutrients to plant roots by incorporating liquid and nutrient emitters that allow for the efficient and effective flow of the water into the system. The design, which is suitable for small growth chambers and large-scale crop production, then uses air emitters to move the water and nutrients in the appropriate direction(s).","Since the first flight to the moon, and perhaps before, mankind has been possessed by the idea of space travel as a means for pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and improving the quality of life on earth. Agriculture can help solve the problems of food generation and oxygen/carbon dioxide recycling, which are critical for long-term space exploration. 
One of the challenges of agriculture in zero-gravity or microgravity environments is getting water to move in a useful direction and optimizing that movement so that plants can absorb the water through the roots for a sufficient and useful amount of time. Aeroponics is a proven technology for mass producing food on Earth and is now a feasible solution for mass producing food beyond the Earth’s atmosphere.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Enhanced Magneto-Optic Properties Using Polymer-Coated Magnetite Nanoparticles,Researchers at The University of Arizona's James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences have developed a two-step process for creating Magneto-optical (MO) nanocomposites. First it forms a polymer shell on magnetite-nanoparticles though a surface polymerization process. It then chemically links the shell of each magnetite-nanoparticle to a host polymer matrix to embed the nanoparticles. The polymer shells on such particles prevent the nanoparticles from forming agglomerates and can be used to obtain and/or preserve a particular size dispersion of the nanoparticles. The resulting MO composite materials have a large MO response with tunable properties and can be readily processed to form useful devices.,"Magneto-optical (MO) nanocomposites are a special subclass of nanocomposites that are capable of exhibiting strong magneto-optical behavior. These materials consist of magnetic nanoparticles that are embedded in, suspended in, or otherwise structurally associated with a “host material,” such as an organic polymer. It has been shown that the MO effect of such materials depends on both nanoparticle density and uniformity, but nanoparticle clustering, a common fabrication defect, often causes the MO effect to be significantly reduced. Thus, there is a need to improve the methods for producing nanocomposites, including MO nanocomposites, to reduce unwanted aggregations and/or clusters of the nanoparticles while still allowing controllable nanoparticle spacing and size for tuning nanocomposite properties.",Imaging & Optics
Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative Eigen-projection Adaptive Algorithm for Super-Resolution Imaging,"This technology describes an eigen-projection adaptive algorithm that can be used for super-resolution imaging in a variety of contexts, including life-sciences microscopy or astronomy.","Traditional advanced microscopy or telescopy uses several different measuring methods to estimate brightness, deduce position, and discriminate between object bodies. These methods work well, but often there must be additional technology or algorithms deployed to enhance the resolution.
In this technology, the inventors propose a new and improved adaptive algorithm that can yield super-resolution imaging in a variety of contexts. They propose to do this by having developed a symmetric logarithmic derivative eigen-projection adaptive algorithm. The algorithm works by its two main stages of initialization and establishing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) eigen-projection.",Imaging & Optics
High-Accuracy Receiver for Optical Object Discrimination,"This invention describes a device that functions as a highly accurate and complex receiver for optical object discrimination. This technology has applications and improvements in a large range of object-discrimination-based technologies, such as QR or barcode readers.","Object discrimination technologies are widely used and have wide-ranging applications in various industries. The current standard and closest technology would be QR and passive barcode readers. The inventors have devised a new device and method that improves on applications and accuracy.
In this technology, the receiver will be utilized in high-stability contexts where 1- or 2-dimensional visual codes or other objects must be read or identified using small optics at large distances. Additionally, the technology will be a vast improvement in situations where the use of RF or other active signaling is precluded, such as in automated sensing contexts.",Imaging & Optics
Language Learning Platform for Translators and Interpreters,"This technology is a platform for language learning that combines videos and text translations to help train professional translators and interpreters. Unlike many existing solutions, this platform goes beyond teaching the meaning of isolated words, and focuses on the overall, more subtle meaning of what is being conveyed.","Language learning tools have become progressively more valuable in modern times. Globalization and the rise of the internet have turned bilingualism and multilingualism into a highly valued skill.

Furthermore, interpreters are especially important to ensure that people who don’t understand a local language can still obtain basic benefits afforded the people in that locale. For example, court interpreters help give people more full access to the justice system, and medical interpreters help ensure proper medical treatment in a field where communication is critical for proper diagnosis and treatment. These roles often require an understanding of a language that goes beyond being able to speak conversationally; it is important to understand subtle meaning and cultural context, as well as many advanced or industry-specific terms.",Software & Information Technology
Blood Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Inflammation in the Brain in the Days and Weeks after Stroke,"This invention comprises a method of identifying chronic inflammation in the day(s), weeks, or months after a stroke by measuring matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) in a patient to determine whether therapeutic intervention is required to help immune cells process lipid debris after stroke to reduce secondary neurodegeneration. MMP-12 is a protein biomarker associated with neurological inflammatory diseases and has been found here to be correlated to chronic inflammation in the brain following stroke. Therapeutic efficacy may also be assessed using MMP-12 assays.","According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year. Also about 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. Furthermore, more than 20% of stroke survivors will have neurodegeneration that will lead to the develop a new dementia within one year of their stroke.  Chronic inflammatory response to stroke occurs in the infarcted area of the brain and causes further neurodegeneration in the weeks and months after stroke. This inflammatory response is driven by overwhelmed lipid processing in immune cells processing the lipid rich brain tissue destroyed by the stroke. Conventional treatments focus on imaging or assays immediately following a stroke, but do not include the use of peripheral bio-markers in the days or weeks following to identify patients in which this inflammatory response is occurring or used as a metric for assessing the effectiveness of drugs being used to treat the chronic inflammatory response to stroke.",Healthcare Portfolios
3D Printed Lens for Imaging in Falloposcope,This project proposes three improvements to a falloposcope under development. This falloposcope was designed with optical elements selected for detection of early stage ovarian cancer in fallopian tube epithelium. The data collected by the falloposcope is grounded in a growing body of medical research.,"Although rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late. Pelvic ultrasounds and the CA-125 blood test are generally accurate for detecting late stage III-IV ovarian cancer, but the survival rates are less than 30%, compared with &gt; 90% survival rates for cancer detected in early stages, I-II. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better early detection screening procedures, particularly for high risk women with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. A reliable early detection procedure would provide an option other than removal of all reproductive organs after 40 for high risk women.
Research includes examining early stage lesions on the surface of ovaries and fallopian tube epithelium. Access to the fallopian tubes through the cervix is an attraction option because it does not involve surgery; instead, falloposcopic examination can be done in a clinic with mild sedation. However, to be effective, a falloposcope must be small enough to pass through the narrow 1mm opening from the uterus to the proximal portion of the fallopian tube but it must have sufficient resolution and field of view to image the 4cm wide fimbral portion of the tube approximately 10cm away.",Imaging & Optics
Methods and Apparatus for High-Resolution Tissue Microscopy,This technology is a new type of microscope that allows for rapid diagnosis of skin lesions on a person’s body without the need for invasive procedures.,"Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. Over 20% of all Americans will have skin cancer at some point in their life, and more than two people die of skin cancer in the US every hour. But with early detection, survival rates are high. As a result, the most important factor in fighting the prevalence of the disease is in identifying it early and correctly.
High resolution cross-sectional images of lesions, including high cellular detail, are desirable as a non-invasive alternative to skin biopsies and histology. The VIVASCOPE 3000 is the only commercially available handheld confocal microscope able to image 0.75 mm x 0.75 mm areas to a depth of 250 mm with resolution on the order of 1–5 mm. The VIVASCOPE is a point-scanning system, so each lesion requires 5-10 minutes to create images.",Imaging & Optics
Grasshopper Harvester,Killing two birds with one stone is a common way to describe one solution that takes care of two problems. This invention kills three.,"Insects cause a large plurality of all crop destruction in the United States and certainly in the world. Some studies for crop destruction in the U.S. indicate that insects are responsible for up to 20% of the total crop destruction. Additionally, in the last few years the world is has seen some of the worst locust swarms in decades. In 2020 alone, India saw the largest locust swarm since the early 90s, and East Africa saw the destruction of over 170,000 crop acres via locust swarms. Farmers are almost completely unable to stop these swarms, much less take advantage of these insects.
In conjunction with crop destruction is a rising global population and, with that rise, an increase in the required amount of protein to sustain that population. Insects efficiently break waste down into useable compost, they require very little care to survive, they are much more efficient at turning grass and other matter into protein, and the protein they provide as a food source is low-calorie, high protein yield. Many companies are starting to bet on the future of insect farming, and even the United Nations came out with a report urging the use of insects for animal feed and human consumption. Insects may be a big part of future protein consumption. Finally, the amount of overfishing is unsustainable over long periods of time, because of this, fisheries are becoming a more viable and promising option.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Device for Collecting Volumetric Measurements of Objects with Complex Shapes,"This technology is a device that facilitates accurate and precise volume measurements of solid objects. Originally created for the purpose of measuring the total volume of a sample of plant matter, it is ideal for measuring the volume of any solid material with complex shapes or many holes and gaps.","In agriculture, it is valuable to have methods of measuring the yield of crops in a reliable and repeatable way; this can facilitate precision agriculture practices, where the ideal distribution of nutrients or irrigation are used to maximize crop yields. However, to reliably maximize production, there needs to be a means of accurately and precisely measuring the crop yields. There are many remote sensing technologies being investigated for solving these problems (such as drone, camera, and satellite monitoring, 3D scanning, and soil sensors). However, many of these solutions either offer only a coarse approximation of volume measurement of a plant due to to the complex shape and open gaps in the plants.

This technology offers a simple, inexpensive, and high-fidelity means of measuring the true volume of plant matter, that can be used either on its own or to validate alternative means of volume measurement. Because it can accommodate many types of solid objects beyond just plant material, it has the potential for use anywhere there is a need for high-precision and high-accuracy measurements of the volume of objects with complex shapes.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Targeting CD44-Moesin Interactions with Small Molecules for Alzheimer’s Disease,"This technology is a small molecule compound that could serve as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The compound binds to Moesin, a protein that is associated with AD. It targets interactions between Moesin and CD44, an antigen that also has been shown to be a biomarker for AD. Targeting CD44 and Moesin interactions has proved to be a potential effective therapy for AD.","Alzheimer’s Disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Currently over 6 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with AD, with the number projected to nearly double by 2050. There are currently many treatment options to ameliorate the effects and slow the progression of AD; however, there is no cure for the disease. Furthermore, there are many debates about whether current AD treatments are effective in light of the high costs incurred in production and use. Therefore, it is imperative that new treatment options for Alzheimer’s Disease be developed to combat the devastating effects of the neurodegenerative disease plaguing the elderly population. This technology provides a novel approach to AD therapy and has the potential to effectively treat the disease.",Life Sciences
Novel Peptides Bioavailable to the Brain for Non-Opioid Pain Relief and/or Addiction Treatment,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed oxytocin analogues which have high potency, are designed to be more stable compared to the native oxytocin hormone (an endogenous peptide which inhibits pain and promotes social connection), have very high selectivity for oxytocin receptors, and are bioavailable for brain therapeutics. These druggable compounds may be further developed for use as non-opioid pain relief, social anxiety, anti-addiction, or post-traumatic stress disorder.","Opioid drugs like morphine and Oxycontin® are considered to be the gold standard for managing moderate-to-severe pain, and are often used to treat chronic pain as well. Unfortunately, these drugs are plagued with undesired side effects, particularly respiratory depression, GI effects, euphoria and sedation, and the use of these drugs can lead to opioid use disorder (OUD) and fatal overdose. Prescription rates and subsequent addiction, abuse, and hospital admissions for overdose have soared in the past 20 years for opioid drugs, with fentanyl-related abuse and overdose in particular skyrocketing since 2012. Many strategies have been developed to generate efficacious opioids with reduced addiction potential, such as biased ligands, multifunctional ligands, or endogenous peptide derivatives, but none have yet been translated to clinical use. This unsolved limitation of opioids illustrates the great medical need for effective alternative non-opioid analgesics.

An alternate pain modulatory system of great interest is the oxytocin (OT) neuronal network. Extensive research to date has shown that OT modulates pain. Importantly, OT has been shown to inhibit nociceptive pathways in peripheral nerve terminals, in the spinal cord, and in diverse brain pain regulatory systems including the periaqueductal grey, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate cortex. This pattern is similar to the opioid system, thus explaining the efficacy of OT in modulating pain. Interestingly, modulation of oxytocin receptor (“OXTR”) using an OXTR agonist does not induce the side effects typical of opioid agonists. Opioid receptors and OXTR are neuropeptide receptors, thus given their activities, it is believed that OT can also be used to treat opioid addiction. Furthermore, based on its activity it is believed that OXTR agonists can also be used as non-opioid analgesics. Unfortunately, however, due to the instability of the native disulfide linkage, OT is unsuitable for use as a drug. Moreover, OT cannot readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so it is generally not well suited for use as a pharmaceutical. Recently, intranasal delivery of native OT has been reported. However, this intranasal delivery method misses important sites of OT action in the spinal cord and periphery. While small molecule OXTR ligands have been developed, they have yet to advance to the clinic.",Healthcare Portfolios

The invention includes triazenes for use as bioconjugates, e.g., for use in protein modification, for use as probes (including but not limited to detectable probes such as fluorescent probes), protein crosslinking, etc. Application of UV light at neutral pH releases diazonium species, which can be used in a wide variety of applications, including protein tagging or modification. This chemistry may be used to create libraries of designed conjugates that may be stored safely for long periods of time.",Chemical labeling of proteins is important for understanding protein structure and function. Labeling natural amino acids in protein of interest is one approach to reach this goal. Most of current methods involve harsh conditions which causes protein denaturation or have low reaction yield. The technology intends to improve on these shortcomings through high-yield and better stability. The relatively low prevalence and absence of charge allows for a more controlled labeling without significantly affecting protein stability.,Research Tools
Small Diffusive in Situ Soil Gas Probes and Sampling System for Online Soil Gas Measurements,"This invention is a small soil gas sampling probe that is connected to an individual recirculating loop that includes a micropump and a multiport selective flow-through valve. This design allows for gas to be recirculated and flow through the recirculating loop until analysis. Analysis of the soil gas sample is performed by small sensors using an online sample equilibration, transfer, and measurement system to determine the concentrations of gas at high spatial and temporal resolution without sampling artifacts.","The composition of gas in soil is a powerful indicator of various important soil processes, including microbial activity, soil carbon stability, agricultural nitrogen efficiency, soil health, presence of beneficial or detrimental biological actors, contamination or bioremediation status, and more. However, most technologies that are currently available to measure are invasive and disruptive to the soil due to their large size, which also causes lower resolution measurements for the gas samples. Current technologies also generally are made of costly materials.

This technology solves issues faced by current soil gas analyzing technologies. It instead is a small probe made from cost-effective material, which is less invasive and disruptive given its small size. Its small size additionally allows for higher spatial resolution measurements. This probe also reflects a more accurate representation of the concentration of gas in soil and is user-friendly due to the automation that is able to measure soil gases online.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Rapid Diagnosis of Microbial Pathogens in Aquatic Species,"This technology is a rapid colorimetric assay to detect and diagnose diseases in various aquaculture species by utilizing a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based (RT-LAMP) assay. This product allows sensitive detection of &lt;100 viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogen genomes per reaction without the need for a DNA/RNA purification step. This technology can be used in conjunction with conventional quantitative PCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR without the need for DNA extraction from the sample.","Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food industries due to the nutritional value and many health benefits from consumption of aquatic species. Current technologies to detect diseases in aquaculture species require highly skilled workers to perform the time consuming processes of DNA/RNA purification. This causes traditional detection methods to be expensive to perform. This LAMP technology allows users to skip the usual DNA/RNA purification process, making the method much easier and more cost effective to use while still remaining highly sensitive for detection of viral and bacterial pathogens in aquatic species.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Method and Therapeutic use of PIGN and Other Genes or Gene Products that PIGN Interacts with for Prognosis and Treatment of Hematological Neoplasias,This invention provides a method for determining the risk for the development or progression of a hematologic neoplasia in patients by analyzing the level of a phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis protein (PIGN) and providing a guideline for appropriate treatment or preventive measures.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are classes of hematologic cancers that often progress into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These conditions are especially troubling, as there are typically no symptoms before advanced progression. Additionally, there are currently no commonplace indicators or predictors of risk of development or progression. Phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis protein, or PIGN, has been found here to be a significant biomarker and indicator of the development or progression of hematological neoplasias and AML.

Allosteric NAMPT Activators for Metabolic and Neurological Disorders,"This invention relates to a novel method of increasing the catalytic activity of the enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which in turn increases the production of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) that is converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). This process to increase supply of NAD in the body is accomplished using small-molecule allosteric NAMPT activators. NAD supplementation has been shown to have benefits towards diseases of aging, metabolic disorders, and stroke.","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme that is central to metabolism and is essential for fortifying cells’ defense systems and regulating the body’s circadian rhythm. However, an individual's supply of NAD has been shown to decrease with age. With a decrease in NAD in the body, there are many associated health risks, such as neurodegeneration and metabolic dysregulation. Lower NAD levels can also be associated with stroke. For that reason, medications to increase one’s supply of NAD have been linked to many health benefits in the aging process. This product uses a novel pharmacological approach to restoring NAD by utilizing a new agent that activates the enzyme NAMPT, which is responsible for catalyzing the production of NAD.",Life Sciences
"THALASSA (Software Tool for High-Accuracy, Long-Term Analyses for Space Situational Awareness)","THALASSA (Software Tool for High-Accuracy, Long-Term Analyses for Space Situational Awareness) is a numerical code for software that is to be used to calculate trajectories of uncontrolled objects in near-Earth space from initial position and velocity. This software also poses a non-averaged method of calculating Earth satellite orbit propagations. The software efficiently handles strong lunar gravitational perturbations through a trajectory splitting algorithm.","Due to increased access to space attributed to technological advancements, Resident Space Objects (RSOs) are expected to rise significantly in the coming years. There are currently methods to catalog these RSOs; however, there is a need for more highly accurate technologies for space surveillance to calculate the trajectories of uncontrolled objects in near-Earth space.
Current methods generally involve averaging methods to measure long-term orbit propagation, which are only subject to long-periodic and secular behaviors for use on long-time spans. The advantage of this technology over existing commercial and free orbit propagation packages consists in the excellent computational performance of the software. This will significantly improve on existing methods for orbit determination and collision avoidance of Earth satellites, which is necessary to avoid the proliferation of orbital debris.",Software & Information Technology
Systems and Methods for Identity Authentication using the Keystroke Dynamics of a Single Interaction Session,This technology is a method of detecting an online impostor using keystroke dynamics without requiring prior collection of behavioral data from the true user.,"Keystroke dynamics is an area of behavioral biometrics that attempts to identify or authenticate a user by collecting data about how a user types, such as the length of time between key presses and the duration a key is depressed. This information can then be used to detect changes in typing behavior, which may suggest the person typing is an impostor or bot. This technique has seen widespread adoption in recent years and adds a layer of security that can augment traditional knowledge-based authentication such as providing a username and password.
One limitation of keyboard dynamics for authentication is that it usually requires establishing a baseline by training the detection mechanism with normal typing activity by the authentic user. As a result, keyboard dynamics is generally ineffective if the user is new or no prior data has been collected on the user’s behavior. This invention is innovative in that it requires no prior user interaction and therefore can be used for new accounts or in applications where behavioral data is not collected across multiple interaction sessions.",Software & Information Technology
RESTORE Program of Restorative Justice Resolution of Sexual Misconduct,This invention is a restorative justice (RJ) conferencing program adapted to prosecutor-referred adult misdemeanor and felony sexual assaults.,"The term restorative justice (RJ) subsumes a variety of approaches to wrong-doing including crimes and student misconduct. RJ approaches share the viewpoint that violation of law and conduct codes causes negative impacts beyond those to the direct victim.
Many RJ program formats exist such as sharing circles, victim–offender dialogue, victim impact panels, community reparation boards, circles of support, sentencing circles, and conferencing. Scholarly discourse on RJ for sexual assault has been hindered by lack of empirical data and is predominately conceptual and dialectic. Just as there are few conferencing programs designed for sexual assault, published evaluations are scarce.

2-Aryl-Pyridylazoles for the Treatment of Solid Tumors such as Pancreatic Cancer,"University of Arizona researchers have identified two potent small molecules that target a common mutation found in pancreatic cancer cells with high specificity and induce cell death. These compounds are genotype specific for the DPC4 mutation associated with cancer phenotypes and, compared to available treatments, are significantly more potent and have less harmful side effects in normal cells. The anti-tumor agents have been tested in three pancreatic cell lines and have demonstrated a 16- fold selectivity difference against DPC4 deficient cells.","Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of all cancer deaths, due largely to the rapid progression of the disease, the lack of diagnostic tools or effective therapeutics. The response rate of gemcitabine, at present the most effective drug for advanced pancreatic cancer, is approximately 10%.
The search for cancer therapeutics is largely focused on gain-of-function mutations, a strategy reported to be inappropriate for pancreatic cancer. Loss-of- function mutations such as DPC4, a tumor suppressor gene that is turned off in 55% of pancreatic cancers, has been successfully exploited to distinguish between normal cells and tumor cells. The investigators identified the highly selective and lethal molecules that target DPC4 using a cell-based pharmacological synthetic lethal screening approach (Wang, et al., Proc.

Photocatalytic Alpha Arylation of Carbonyl at Room Temperature to Simplify and Reduce Costs of Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals,"This invention is a new synthesis route for producing an alpha-aryl substituted cyclic ketone from a cyclic ketone compound using an aryl halide and an acridinium ion photocatalyst.  The method of the invention is particularly useful in producing an alpha-aryl substituted cyclic ketone from an un-activated cyclic ketone compound. This is vast improvement to the synthesis of building blocks to many different fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This allows companies to perform the alpha arylation at room temperature, in the absence of expensive and toxic metals, and with commonly available white or green light.","The development of practical methods for the arylation of carbonyl compounds is, and has long been, a challenge in organic synthesis. Typically, this has been done through catalysis using expensive metals, such as palladium, and with temperatures exceeding 130°C or 266°F. All of this contributes to the difficulty of manufacturing commercial important intermediates for fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals especially face difficulty in manufacturing because of heavy regulation regarding the use of heavy metals in the manufacturing process.

For example, ketamine is one of the largest breakthroughs in severe depression in years when it was developed. Currently the process of synthesizing ketamine is an eight-step process that requires metal complexes and toxic reagents. With this synthesizing technique, Ketamine could be synthesized in four steps without any of the expensive metals or toxic reagents. Furthermore, the four steps now require much lower temperatures, around room temperature, and photosynthesizing agents instead of heavy metals.",Materials
Returning Jaguars,"Scientists at the UA Conservation Genetics Lab created the documentary “Returning Jaguars” for viewers to learn about the Southern Arizona jaguar as well as topics such as regional land management and conservation that impacts the jaguars. The documentary describes methods of jaguar detection motion cameras, scat sampling, and hair sampling. The camera tracking method for jaguars and ocelots uses cameras deployed at 140 sites over 16 mountain ranges, and the success of this method makes it a model for other research programs tracking large mammals. Given the large number of cameras and large detection area, collaboration with local residents and multiple government agencies is vital. This documentary serves to educate both the general public and residents with affected land about the program, its impact, and its importance.","In Southern Arizona over the last 15 years, solitary male jaguars—typically one at any given time—have migrated from Northern Mexico into Southern Arizona and New Mexico. Controversial lawsuits and federal actions for habitat designation for this endangered species has raised concerns in the ranching community that operates on—and in some cases owns—the land within these boundaries. Although habitat designation fuels the perception that the ranching livelihood is under threat, it’s unlikely that the designation in itself will have any impact on the ranching operations within jaguar critical habitat. Instead, the protection of these large, unfragmented open spaces is mutually critical for both the jaguar and the ranchers.

Deconvolution of Charge Detection-Mass Spectrometry Data,"This mass spectrometry analysis software and method extends the UniDec Bayesian deconvolution algorithm for application to two-dimensional charge detection-mass data.  A 2D plot of m/z versus charge is created from raw data.  Smoothing and background subtraction may be used, and deconvolution is applied to remove uncertainty in the charge and the m/z dimension to smooth neighboring charge and mass states.","Mass spectrometry (MS) and intact mass analysis are increasingly common in academic and industry research.  This has created a demand for more robust approaches to MS analysis.  UniDec is one approach. UniDec is a software package based on a Bayesian deconvolution algorithm. The algorithm provides a rapid and robust approach to deconvolving electrospray mass spectra into their corresponding mass and charge components. However, when the UniDec algorithm is applied, several types of artifacts including harmonic charge states and +/- 1 charge state uncertainty may arise depending on the quality and complexity of the data. Removing these artifacts improves the results of the deconvolution process.",Life Sciences
Novel Mechanism Anti-Fungal with High Specificity,"University of Arizona researchers have discovered a novel approach for treating fungal<!-- notionvc: 73a0920b-ed03-4fcd-b915-af47683fe452 --> or yeast infections using a previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, which is integral to the regulation of cell growth in yeast cells. This protein and metabolic pathway is absent in higher-order animals, which provides a novel pathway for drugs to stop the growth of deadly fungal pathogens, such as drug resistant Candida glabrata. This technology may also provide a route to improved control of yeast growth in manufacturing.","This invention builds on a previous UArizona discovery of a novel cell signaling pathway/mechanism regulating cell growth and metabolism via TORC1, that is present in simple eukaryotes, such as fungi, yeast, and some parasites, but is not present in higher-order animals. To function correctly, cells set their growth rate based on a wide array of factors, such as nutrient, stress, and hormone signals. In eukaryotes, this fine-tuned control depends, in a large part, on a single, highly-conserved, signaling hub called the Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1). In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 drives growth by activating protein, ribosome, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. In contrast, when nutrient or hormone levels drop, TORC1 is repressed, causing cells to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism, and eventually enter a quiescent state.",Research Tools
Photo-Magnetically Actuated Deformable Mirror,"This technology is a flexible deformable mirror and wireless actuator using a combination of light and magnetic components, to enable large and small scale deformations.","Deformable mirrors (DMs) are special mirrors designed to be deformed to provide optical aberration correction in high performance optical systems. These mirrors are particularly useful in astronomy and retinal imaging where image quality needs to be maximized at high magnifications, as well as in control and shaping of laser beams.

Traditional DMs use an array of actuators behind the mirror which deform the mirror when electricity is applied to the actuators. This approach requires many, often high-voltage, electrical connections. This technology, on the other hand, deforms the mirror wirelessly, simplifying the design while simultaneously allowing large amounts of deformation and precise control.",Imaging & Optics
Elimination of Aflatoxin via Aflatoxin-Degrading Enzyme Expression in Crops,"This technology involves the expression of an aflatoxin-degrading enzyme in maize kernels. The enzyme was engineered to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and become expressed using an embryo-specific promoter in the transgenic maize. It can be used in combination with an RNAi suppression method, HIGS, to protect maize during pre-harvest conditions.","It is estimated that 25% of the world’s crops are contaminated with a mycotoxin, a toxin produced by fungal sources. Aflatoxins are one class of mycotoxins that have two particularly toxic strains that are often found in maize, peanuts, cotton, and tree nuts. When ingested through the consumption of these crops, aflatoxin has been shown to be a Group 1 carcinogen for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Many countries restrict the levels of aflatoxins allowed in food, which results in millions of crops being disposed of each year.
Most prior methods to reduce the prevalence of aflatoxins in crops have been insufficient and still result in the loss of many crops. Because aflatoxin contaminates crops in both pre-harvest and post-harvest storage, it is essential to have a method that is capable of working under both conditions. This method introduces a bioengineered aflatoxin-degrading enzyme that has the capability to prevent contamination in both conditions when combined with an RNAi suppression method in post-harvest. This method provides the potential to significantly impact food security and safety globally in any crop susceptible to mycotoxins.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Controlled Transfer of Endohyphal Symbionts among Fungal Strains,"University of Arizona researchers discovered that diverse endophytic fungi were found to harbor endohyphal bacteria (EHB), which live within apparently healthy, viable fungal cells. Differences in suites of EHB between closely related fungal endophytes suggest horizontal transfer of these symbionts in nature. This relationship appears facultative for both partners, as bacteria can grow freely under laboratory conditions and the researchers successfully cured fungi of their EHB.","Plant-associated fungi provide important ecosystem services as pathogens, mycorrhizae, endophytes, and saprotrophs. Endophytic fungi colonize healthy, living plant tissues in all biomes, often providing protection from pathogens, herbivores, and other environmental stressors. Saprotrophic fungi are the primary decomposers of senescent plant materials, cycling nutrients by breaking down cellulose and lignin. Many fungi play more than one of these roles throughout their life cycles, with functional switches in ecological modes driven in part by interactions with additional microbes.",Agriculture & Horticulture

Photo-Curable Liquid Acrylate and Methacrylate Modified Silsesquioxane Oligomers with Built In Radical Initiators for Additive Manufacturing,"This invention is a new photochemically curable resin with photo initiators for radical curing. This invention allows for faster curing rates using high and controlled concentrations of initiators. The invention also improves upon currently available resins, as this invention reduces the chances of resin chemical leaching and solves plasticization issues. It provides for a more durable and safer product.","The current composition of the photo-curable resin used in practice today are composed of mixtures of acrylate or methacrylate monomers and comonomers which have multiple cross-linked groups. These mixtures permit an application that does not need to use a solvent but then creates pores or results in shrinkage, drying stress and cracking. This also causes plasticization and chemical leaching from the resin. This invention solves this problem by providing a new type of photo-curable resin that eliminates plasticization and makes leaching improbable.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Guayule Particle Board,"This invention is a particle-board comprising a fiber component including guayule bagasse and an adhesive composition including a mixture of a modified guayule resin and soy protein. The resultant composite has mechanical properties comparable to particle boards formed from soy protein adhesives alone while also having enhanced wet shear strength, and hence improved water repellent features, as compared with particle-boards formed from soy protein adhesives alone. The use of guayule also provides for enhanced anti-termite and/or enhanced anti-insect properties as compared with particle-boards formed from non-bio-based adhesives and wood fibers.","The cost of making wood composite has increased due to the increase in the price of wood supply; hence, guayule bagasse could be one of the alternative less expensive options. Guayule, a plant that grows in the Southwest United States and Mexico, is a promising source of hypoallergenic natural latex rubber, requiring little water to cultivate. However, extracting latex from Guayule requires processing the entire plant, leaving most of the plant’s biomass as a byproduct. This invention supports the need to find valuable new uses for the byproducts of the latex extraction process to increase the overall economics of guayule as a sustainable crop for desert environments. While using Guayule bagasse as a replacement for wood is the first step in this technology’s solution, the current resin used to adhere the composite is still concerning. Accordingly, developing a wood composite with all natural and renewable materials that combine guayule resins with soy proteins, and which utilize guayule bagasse as the fiber component, could provide one solution for addressing the global demand of environmentally-friendly and sustainable products such as wood composites or particle-board.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

Sugar-Based Low Molecular Weight Hydrogels from Alkyl Glycolipids,"University of Arizona researchers have created sugar-based low molecular weight hydrogels that spontaneously self-assemble through weak, noncovalent intermolecular interactions. These gels are thixotropic, biocompatible, and biodegradable. Despite being held together through non-covalent interactions, these hydrogels exhibit greater mechanical strength than other non-cross-linked hydrogels. These hydrogels are biocompatible and biodegradable since the materials are based on sugars. The other advantages of these low molecular weight hydrogels include resistance to acidic and salty environments, stability at human body temperature, and formation in water without requiring additives. These hydrogels are based on alkyl glycolipids which are readily produced in large quantities through a scalable, high-yield synthetic process.","Hydrogels have been utilized in many biomedical fields, including dermatology, drug delivery systems, stem cell delivery systems, bonding and coating systems, tissue engineering or repairing systems, wound healing, cell culture, etc.  One current field of study is concerned with tissue and tissue manipulation using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) compounds.  Another field of study is using biopolymer-based hydrogels as scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices that provide growth spaces for cells from the viewpoint of tissue engineering. The scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices allow cells to grow better or in desired directions for the purpose of tissue engineering. Some of the biopolymers currently used for producing hydrogels include polysaccharides such as glycogen, chitosan, cellulose, and hyaluronic acid. These biopolymers are often converted into hydrogels by physical crosslinking or irreversible chemical crosslinking. The process of cross-linking biopolymers to produce hydrogels results in high molecular weight hydrogels and requires additional time and cost.

Unlike high molecular weight hydrogels, low molecular weight gels (LMW) are composed of small molecules that aggregate via noncovalent interactions and form fibrous 3-D networks or porous structures that immobilize solvent. Thus, LMW gels do not need any cross-linking steps, and therefore, are less costly and time consuming. In addition, LMW gels are known to be thermoreversible, gel at low concentrations, and have high tolerance towards salts. LMW hydrogels are some of the most unique gels, as they are mainly composed of water; this allows their potential use in diverse applications in soft materials and biomaterials including drug delivery, cell growth, enzyme immobilization, and tissue engineering. Sugars have long been of interest for use in LMW hydrogels. However, common hydrogel compositions with functional properties utilizing sugars have relied on complex gelator molecules with relatively complex chemical syntheses or are based on materials harvested from natural sources requiring extensive effort. Therefore, there is a need for a simple method of producing LMW hydrogels using readily available sources.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

While this is the main market, optical accelerometers are used for seismic and vibration analysis, inertial measurement, automotive security monitoring, and motion, tilt, and swivel applications in gaming devices.
As technology advances, there has been an increasing need for MEMS sensors to become more accurate and take more measurements. This device is capable of achieving micro-g sensitivity for acceleration sensing and is easily integrated with other advanced photonics devices. Generally, MEMS devices lack the stability and accuracy required for autonomous navigation; more complex and expensive interferometric methods for measuring acceleration are needed. An accelerometer that is accurate, stable and inexpensive to integrate within electronics would be an improvement to the market.",Imaging & Optics
Instrumentation and Methods for Optical Metrology of Heliostats,"This technology solves the need to recognize and track the shape of adjustable and customizable heliostats by using a receiver fly eye lens, through which a metrology camera can quickly capture the beams of light coming through the array of apertures and determine their centroids and angles, therefore determining the shape and direction of the heliostat. The heliostat is then adjusted to maximize the system’s reflective efficiency and increasing the overall efficiency of the plant itself.","Concentrated solar power (CSP) is a method of generating power by using heliostats to direct the solar radiation to a tower. This typically heats molten salt, the thermal energy from which is used to power a steam turbine. One of the many challenges to using this method of power generation is channeling the solar energy in the most efficient way at all times of the day. This has required practitioners, including those at the University of Arizona, to create heliostats that can customize their shape to maximize solar radiation collection.
Solar power is difficult to harness consistently for a multitude of reasons, one of which is a lack of sunlight. Because the sun does not shine everywhere, it is imperative to create solar fields in places where the sun shines consistently and then maximize the efficiency when the sun is shining. Because of that, every efficiency increase brings the technology one step closer to competing with fossil fuels to power communities the world over.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
PLpro Inhibitors Against SARS-CoV-2,"There are two cysteine proteases that are encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). Both of these proteases have been shown to be essential in viral replication and are validated antiviral drug targets. PLpro cleaves the viral SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein at three sites. In addition, it modulates host immune response by cleaving the ubiquitin and ISG modifications from host proteins. This technology identified several novel compounds that are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Because of its role in viral replication and immune modulating, inhibition of PLpro is expected to provide therapeutic benefits in patients that are infected with SARS-CoV-2.","As of February 1, 2021, there have been over 27 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and nearly half a million deaths related to the virus. Worldwide there have been over 100 million cases of COVID-19, with over 2.2 million dead from the virus. The virus also has been damaging to the global economy as well as the U.S. economy. Despite the devastation caused by the virus, there are still very few FDA-approved treatments for those who become infected with the virus. In late 2020, two vaccines were approved for emergency use to be administered to prevent the disease; however, a very small percentage of individuals have been able to receive that vaccine. Therefore, it is essential that more treatment options become available for those that become ill with COVID-19.
This technology introduces novel, highly-potent PLpro inhibitory compounds that will be able to be used to stop the viral replication of COVID-19. This can be used retroactively to slow the spread of the disease in individuals who have already become infected with COVID-19. PLpro inhibitors have also been shown to be useful antivirals for other human coronaviruses, giving this technology potential to be used to develop treatments for future infectious diseases that resemble COVID-19.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Mood Altering Device, System and Method","This invention is a small device, suitable for home or personal use, that exposes the user to green light and other sensory stimuli, for the purposes of elevating their mood.","Mood disorders and negative moods are pervasive in the modern world. The World Health Organization estimates that over a quarter of a million people worldwide suffer from depression. In the same vein, an estimated 7.1% of all US adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2017. And these numbers are limited to the clinical definition of depression; other people may experience shorter-lived depressed mood or other negative moods but would not meet the clinical criteria to be classified as suffering from a depressive disorder.

Mood is also closely intertwined with general health and wellbeing. Research suggests that adults with a depressive disorder or depressive symptoms have a 64% increased risk of coronary artery disease, and early treatment of depression can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes by nearly 50%. Furthermore, depression accounts for 490 million disability days taken off work each year in the US, at an estimated economic cost of $100 billion per year.

Light does more than merely allow people to see the world around them; indeed it has been shown to affect the regulation of sleep, mood, and learning and cognitive function. Recently, studies have suggested that green light therapy, when carefully calibrated for intensity, duration, and wavelength, has positive effects on someone’s mood.

This device leverages the mood-elevating properties of green light, combining light exposure with other sensory stimuli that, when used together, maximize the device’s mood-elevating potential.",Life Sciences
"Systems, Methods and Devices for Light Exposure via Visual Displays","This technology is a system and device that modifies visual displays such as computer screens, televisions, and smartphone screens to emit light at wavelengths that provide therapeutic effects.","As electronic devices with display screens are becoming increasingly common, the amount of time spent in front of screens is correspondingly growing. A UK survey found that the respondents spent, on average, 3 hours and 23 minutes of screen time per day, adding up to 50 days over a year. Screen time is particularly high among teens and tweens; in 2019, teens spent 7 hours and 22 minutes of screen time per day, even after excluding screen time for school or homework.

Given the trends in screen time, it is no surprise that society has paid increased attention to the potential harmful effects of spending so much time in front of display screens. In particular, the blue light emitted by these devices has been linked to eye problems such as dry eye, cataracts, and macular degeneration, as well as disruption of biochemical processes like production of melatonin and other hormones. In response to these concerns, solutions have been developed that limit blue light exposure from electronic devices. Popular solution include software that eliminates blue light or simulates the natural sunrise/sunset cycle, tinted glasses, and sheets applied to the physical screen.

This invention takes a different approach. Instead of merely eliminating the effects of blue light, it provides a controllable source of green light. Green light has been shown to be have therapeutic properties, including for pain reduction and reducing the severity and frequency of migraines. This invention therefore offers the potential to provide therapeutic effects by precise control of the intensity, duration, and wavelengths of green light during use of electronic devices.",Life Sciences
Personalized Dietary Recommendations guided by Continuous Glucose Monitoring,"This invention is a method for integrating glucose monitoring data with a mobile diet tracker to automate personalized dietary recommendations with the goal of improving health and preventing disease related to or caused by the dysregulation of glucose metabolism, including but not limited to diabetes.","Diabetes is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 8th edition, there are currently 425 million people living with diabetes. More than 90% of these people are living with type 2 diabetes (T2D). There are another 352 million with a pre-stage of diabetes, called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). By 2045, the number of people with diabetes is forecast to increase by 48%.

Many diet and glucose tracking apps are available; however, none of these self-monitoring tools integrate dietary data with glucose data to provide personalized dietary recommendations aimed to prevent and treat disease.

This application will have the potential to provide personalized dietary guidance that is based on the user’s glycemic response to typically-consumed foods and beverages.",Software & Information Technology
"Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding, and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Mobile Application (App)","The United States and many other western countries have aging populations. With age comes wisdom, but also a myriad health problems. Of those health problems, hypertension is one of the leading causes of heart complications and death. Approximately 30 million people in the United States currently take blood pressure medication to mitigate the risks of hypertension. Blood pressure medication staves off the long term effects of high blood pressure over years. However, individuals must take this medication regularly and in specified windows. If a time window is missed, individuals may have too much or too little of the medication in their systems for the medication to be effective.","There are a few trends that allow the success of this technology. One is the increasing average age in the United States and the need for regularly taken medications. The other trend is an increase in the number of individuals over 60 who regularly carry smartphones, which is now over 40%. With both of these trends happening on parallel timelines, it is high time for an app that allows people in this demographic to get educated about the medication they take. And, perhaps most importantly, if a time window was missed for taking specific medications, the app can let the individual know if it is safe to take their medication at that point.

Even with the advances in technology, the available medication reminders are either on some sort of clock or an smartphone timer. In addition, there are medication dispensers that help people remember when to take their medication based on the last time the container was opened. With the advent of all of this new technology however, there needs to be an educational aspect to taking medication and allowing individuals to take control of their own healthcare. This is the first step.",Software & Information Technology

Education Technology to Assist Learners,"Education disparities are a hallmark of conversation between politicians, school board members, teachers, and parents across the nation. 2020 has brought on a new perspective, students involved in mandatory online education without being able to consistently be online creates an obvious new disparity. This technology seeks to solve the problem and resolve the disparity between those who have technology and internet access and those who do not.","The reactionary public policy stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has left families, students, teachers, and administrators to wonder how they can deliver an education to everyone within their territorial limits.

What do we do with the vast number of people who do not have access to either technology or consistent internet access? Those individuals are currently being left behind and fault may be attributed to parents or guardians, but the young students are those who are not receiving an education.

It is incumbent on the school systems with their federal mandate to educate the public. Therefore, the logic flows, that if the government is to take away the opportunity to learn in person, they must give students another way to access the education from which they are now shut out. So far, schools and local governments have acted negligently in assuming widespread access to technology and the internet.

Domain Transferable Neural Network Architecture for Fact Verification,"The problem this invention solves is that of spurious patterns or invalid results from software neural networks tasked to use natural language programming for fact verification in news or articles. This approach increases the accuracy of fact verification. Neural architectures with improved transfer between domains enables re-use of trained models, saving protracted re-training periods. This enables ranking of content, such as news articles, based on their factuality.","We’ve witnessed growing political upheaval in the last few years, thanks to the proliferation of “fake news” online — much of which is disinformation that’s deliberately designed to spread virally and mislead public opinion for political purposes. Research shows that on average, a false story will disseminate to 1,500 people six times more quickly than a factual one, especially if it’s related to politics, and particularly when bots are used to further automate the propagation of fake news. Enormous amounts of content placed online every day render human fact checking impossible for the magnitude of fake news and false information. Tools utilizing deep learning, machine learning, AI, and algorithms to fact check speeches, posts, and articles are increasingly needed. While cable news networks and print publications may have human fact checking resources, most online information is not automatically analyzed by computer systems. Having the option of access to AI fact checking via a web browser extension would improve access by the general public to highly effective verification. An extension with this capability would be able to alert users if a site provides potentially spurious information/fake news.",Software & Information Technology

"Method, System and Devices for Generating Defined Fiber Constructs","This invention is a novel method to the improvement of nano-fiber scaffolding. The cells that make up every human, or any organism for that matter, are held together largely depending on the extra-cellular matrices within different tissues (bone, skin, tendons, blood vessels etc.). These matrices help to keep the cells in place and provide a structure upon which cells are able to proliferate and adhere correctly. Electrospinning has proven to be a way to recreate scaffolding using micro and nano fibers that also allow cells to adhere and propagate.","Tissue replacement and repair are some of the important goals of tissue engineering. Much like any other form of rebuilding, scaffolding needs to be built to support the proliferation and adhesion of cells and, in this case, smooth muscle cells. Electrospinning is a widely recognized process for the replication of tissue matrix composition, topography, and other mechanical properties of natural tissue stroma. The process of electrospinning can be done with biologic or synthetic materials with the purpose of the electrospun scaffolds to provide a base for cellular adhesion which could facilitate faster wound healing.
This study focused on differences in cellular adhesion and retention in different topographies generated on a 2D plate.

System and Method for Streak Reduction in MRI,"This technology is a new technique for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction that reduces or eliminates streaking in radial MRI images without significant signal loss. It can be used on its own or working together with existing streak reduction techniques, such as iterative reconstruction.","Radial sampling (as opposed to Cartesian sampling) in MRI is particularly useful in reducing scan times and producing images resistant to artifacts caused by the subject’s motion. This makes radial sampling particularly useful in abdominal imaging, where it is difficult to keep the abdomen still. However, streaking artifacts often result in these images, making the image difficult to read and could potentially result in misdiagnosis of a condition.

Existing techniques to correct for the streaking have some success but are limited in their effectiveness. For example, one technique is to remove the samples causing the biggest streaks, but this can often result in degradation of the overall image quality, which still leads to difficulty reading the image. This technology, on the other hand, can reduce or eliminate streaks, while still preserving the quality of the underlying image.",Imaging & Optics

These wearable systems for health monitoring are capable of measuring physiological parameters, such as vital signs (i.e., heart rate, respiration rate, body and skin temperature, oxygen saturation, etc.), skin conductance, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), acceleration, rotation, etc. What makes this research unique is that the device is more durable and its capabilities flexible than other devices currently offered. The electrodes in this invention will be protected from the sweat to avoid degradation and thee electrodes can also be tweaked for selectivity of biomarkers.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
eNAMPT mAb for Treatment of Acute Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction,"This invention is a highly novel theranostic target, extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (eNAMPT), that can afford specific detection and treatment of post-infarct inflammation-mediated myocardial injury based on an eNAMPT-neutralizing humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb).","Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for an estimated 17.5 million deaths each year – around one in every three. The WHO estimates that, by 2030, this death toll will rise to around 24 million. eNampt acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine contributing to cardiac hypertrophy, myocyte cell death, and interstitial fibrosis. This inflammation reaction following myocardial infarction and reperfusion has been found to be a crucial factor in ventricular remodeling, heart failure, and cardiovascular death.

This invention is a method for the detection of eNampt, selective inhibition of eNampt, prevention/treatment of cardiac disease, and detection of locations of eNampt secretion comprising an eNampt mAb.",Life Sciences
Kappa Opioid Receptor Antagonists for Sleep Disorders,"Researchers at UArizona have discovered that kappa opioid receptors influence sleep in mice struggling with chronic pain. In particular they found that a kappa opioid receptor antagonist could be beneficial for improvement of sleep related to pain conditions, as well as other conditions where increased kappa opioid receptor signaling has been observed. This second portion of related conditions includes depression, generalized anxiety disorder, alcoholism, and drug addiction.","Disruption of sleep is a pertinent problem to patients who struggle with chronic pain. There is also the problem of a disruption of sleep, or lack of sleep in general, increasing pain for patients. Because treatment of pain typical ignores treatment of sleep, and vice-versa, treatments that improve both are lacking the market.",Healthcare Portfolios
Circadian Responses to Light-Flash Exposure: Conceptualization and Data Guiding Future Directions,"Though perhaps not often thought of first, the circadian system in the human body is essential to important daily and cyclical bodily functions including: hormone release, temperature control, eating habits, mood, sleep, etc. Those circadian responses in the human body are primarily triggered by light exposure. There is a body of research surrounding mammalian exposure to light pulses and the effects of those light pulses on the circadian rhythm.","The circadian system influences the date and time perceptions of the human body and, with that information, the human body responds accordingly. Understanding and influencing the circadian timing allows for simple things like improving moods to changing the health and well-being of an individual suffering from chronic ailments. Traditionally, circadian timing has been influenced with elongated exposure to bright synthetic light to perhaps shift the circadian system.

While it has been established that elongated light stimulation can, and does, shift circadian timing, that elongated timeline is not efficient nor is it practical for many individuals wishing to influence their circadian system in hopes of positive effects. However, with the hopes that much faster exposures to light would allow the subject to feel the benefits of shifting their circadian timing, the very real possibility of affecting that shift with light begins to take shape. This technology and study seeks to do just that. Practically influence the human circadian system with only light and with light exposure on the scale of microseconds and nanoseconds rather than hours.",Healthcare Portfolios
Semi-Synthetic 17beta-Hydroxywithanolides (17-Bhws) Promote Caspase-8-Dependent Apoptosis in Renal Carcinoma and Melanoma and Specifically Inhibit Human Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation,"This novel, partially naturally-derived compound can be used to treat three different kinds of cancer (melanoma, renal carcinoma, and prostate cancer) in patients without other treatment options.","The treatment of all kinds of cancers leaves much to be desired in terms of an efficient treatment that is highly effective and has comparably lower side-effects. Treatments that target multiple kinds of cancers and are precise in their targeting are in high demand. The compound in this invention has the potential to treat melanoma, renal carcinoma, and/or prostate cancer patients.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Virtual Reality Simulation for Airway Management,"This invention is a dual haptic-virtual reality task training system for medical students and/or professionals learning tracheal tube intubation. This technology combines the current training method and a mannequin with VR/AR and a haptic feedback and force measuring system. By creating a medical training system with a more life-like simulation, users can experience the inherent difficulties encountered in performing intubation and use the visual, tactile, and force feedback systems to improve their technique.","An endotracheal tube is placed when a patient is unable to breath on their own. It is also necessary to use when the patient needs to be sedated and “rest” or protect the airway. These tubes are used on patients in a wide variety of environments. Also, the trachea varies in condition from patient to patient. Placement of the tracheal tube comes with complications, vomiting of patient, swelling of airway, and other conditions in which the doctor loses visibility of the trachea and causes impairment with placement of the tube. Due to these issues, there are short-term complications that may arise. These include bleeding, improper placement of the endotracheal tube, infection, injury to mouth/throat, or aspirations of contents of the mouth/stomach during tube placement.

Currently, to train medical students, or any profession that would use the endotracheal tube, mannequins are used. The issue with mannequins is the inability to simulate high risk/stress situations that medical professionals may incur. This invention provides a solution by combining a mannequin with a dual haptic-VR system that tells the user when too much force is being used on the patient and when harm may result.",Healthcare Portfolios
Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with a Polypeptide,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2, a cell surface protein receptor. The ACE2 binding reduces the ability of ACE2 to break down Angiotensin-II (Ang-II). Ang-II is a potent vasoconstrictor that can increase lung injury and lung edema, increase blood pressure, and can be harmful to organ function at high concentrations.","In March 2020, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, became a global pandemic and since then has infected more than 92 million people worldwide, killing nearly 2 million of those people. Even over a year since the first SARS-CoV-2 was reported, there are still very few treatment options available to counteract the negative effects of the viral infection. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. This treatment also can be effective against other coronaviruses.

This treatment technology is rapidly metabolized in the blood into biologically active fragments and can be continuously infused by any suitable route that permits such continuous infusion, including intravenously. It can be used to treat a variety of symptoms of coronavirus infections by improving the functions of the lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, coagulation parameters, brain, and heart.",Life Sciences
Sphyingolipid-Derived Cancer Nanotherapeutics,"This invention is an improvement to a commonly used drug delivery vehicle: liposomes. Liposomes, while useful for their improved pharmacokinetics, have not demonstrated significantly improved efficacy and patient survival. This may be in part due to the fact that generally only one drug can be loaded per liposome. However, this technology allows co-delivery of multiple drugs. Coupled with its sphingolipid composition, this technology has the potential to result in therapeutics that not only have improved stability and circulation time, but also greater efficacy in treating patients. It is also a versatile approach that enables the creation of liposomal formulations of drugs which are not currently possible with existing liposomes.","Liposomes (spherical lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous center) can be used to deliver hydrophilic drugs (in the center cavity) or hydrophobic drugs (within the lipid membrane). Compared to non-liposomal drugs, liposomes circulate in the bloodstream for a longer period of time, and they are also capable of accumulating at the sites of tumors or infections. Improvements to their structures have been made—they can be temperature- or pH-sensitive for controlled release, or coated in PEG to reduce immune detection—but there is still much room for improvement in clinical outcomes. Traditional liposomes compete with other methods of drug delivery, such as lipid nanoparticles and micelles, but this invention is poised to begin a new era of improved liposomes with broader applicability in terms of payload, and improved therapeutic outcomes.",Life Sciences
Discovery of Non-Covalent Inhibitors Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,"This technology encompasses the development of novel inhibitors for the main protease, or Mpro, of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated drug target and could be key to the development of more antiviral drugs against the virus. The inhibitors proposed in this technology are notable, as they are non-covalent inhibitors with high enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought forth an urgent need for novel drugs and therapeutics to help fight the novel disease. Demand for an effective and safe antiviral drug has been extremely high throughout the pandemic. One possible drug target that various researchers have identified is the main protease or “Mpro” of the SARS-CoV-2. The main protease is key to the viral life-cycle, as it allows for the virus to make functional viral proteins.

The majority of current antiviral drugs target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by covalent modification of a cysteine residue by reactive warhead. This technology proposes and tests two inhibitors that inhibit the same protease, but do so non-covalently. Even when compared to another existing non-covalent inhibitor, the two compounds proposed by this technology showed increased enzymatic inhibition, stronger affinity, and significant antiviral ability in cell culture.",Life Sciences
Method and Apparatus for In-Line Photoacoustic Imaging,"This technology is an optical system consisting of a right angle prism, or thin parallel plate, in conjunction with water, an index matching fluid, or some other liquid, that completely reflects acoustic waves to and from an array ultrasound transducer while being optically transparent. The geometry allows simultaneous direct illumination, with high-energy laser pulses, of the region imaged by the ultrasound transducer array.  This extends the existing capabilities of an ultrasound transducer with the ability to acquire photoacoustic data.","The photoacoustic effect is a conversion between light and acoustic waves due to absorption and localized thermal excitation. When rapid pulses of light are incident on a sample of matter, they can be absorbed and the resulting energy will then be radiated as heat. This heat causes detectable sound waves due to pressure variation in the surrounding medium.",Imaging & Optics
Therapeutic Target to Attenuate Virus-Mediated Arthritis and Improve Immunity,"This invention includes methods and pharmaceutics used to treat alphavirus infections by inhibiting specific cytokine production. These cytokines impair the immune response to the infection and causes inflammation, so its inhibition hastens recovery and diminishes symptom severity.","Varying immune response to alphaviral infections (specifically Chikungunya virus) is based on specific cytokine production, including the target cytokine of this treatment method. The inventors identified these cytokines and their effect on immune response. The inventors also demonstrated cytokine-inhibiting treatments as a method improving immune response and diminishing joint swelling in adult and old mice.",Healthcare Portfolios
Therapeutic and Prophylactic Measures of Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) in Shrimp,"Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) also known as Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) is one of the most devastating diseases for shrimp farming in the last decade. Since its discovery in 2009, AHPND caused $2.56 billion dollars worth of losses in Vietnam, $11.6 billion in Thailand, and significant losses worldwide as the disease increases its geographic reach.","Demand for shrimp the world over has increased in recent years for a number of reasons. These include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>An increase in the middle class income in developing countries</li>
<li>An increase in seafood consumption</li>
<li>The continuing ease with which products are shipped around the world </li>
</ul>
Because demand for shrimp has increased, the need for industrial shrimp farming has also increased to meet that demand. However, just like any other farming practice, the close proximity and intensive farming with high stocking density exacerbates disease problems that otherwise may not be found in nature. Those diseases are the number one challenge in the shrimp industry and account for billions of dollars worth of losses every year.

Each pathogen requires three things: (1) a host; (2) an optimum environment (temperature, proximity etc.); and (3) pathogen present in the water or other organism. Usually, farmers try to disconnect the third prong from the other two. One of the best ways is to give the shrimp some kind of protection from specific pathogens or diseases. One major way to accomplish this is to provide shrimp, from the beginning, feed and feed additives that prevent the pathogen from finding a suitable host in the farm. This research produced the end product designed to provide that defense to shrimp from AHPND.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Genetically Engineered Recombinant Proteins for Functional Regenerative Tissue Scaffolds,"This technology encompasses the development of recombinant tissue-specific proteins that are used to produce hydrogel scaffolds that mimic the structure of natural tissues and are therefore able to harness the function of the tissues. Each protein sequence is able to be precisely customized, which allows the tissues to be biocompatible and efficient in vivo. While versatile, this technology was created to produce a biopolymer scaffold that can be used for cardiovascular tissue applications.","Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide and in the United States. In the U.S., cardiovascular disease is responsible for as many as 1 in 4 deaths. Tissue engineering technologies are a promising method for treating cardiovascular disease; however, currently available methods that use synthetic polymers to produce tissue scaffolds lack efficacy in vivo and can cause debilitating side effects due to their biological incompatibility.

This technology overcomes the issues with currently available conventional polymers for treating cardiovascular disease by using recombinant proteins that reduce the organizational defects caused by polymer networks. Another issue with currently available technologies used for tissue engineering methods is the lack of stability and specificity in current cross-linkers for scaffold production. The researchers here have discovered a cross-linker that is more stable and thus has great potential to mimic protein processes in protein scaffolds.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Handheld, Rapid, Extremely Sensitive Assay of SARS-CoV-2 Infections","This invention is a rapid antigen test to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 that uses a paper microfluidic chip and a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope. Virus-specific antibody-conjugated fluorescent particles and a biological fluid sample (saliva, mouth gargle, etc.) from the patient are added onto a paper microfluidic chip, causing target antigens to flow through the chip and inducing particle to aggregate. The microfluidic chip is then analyzed using the smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, which can count the aggregated particles one-by-one and quantify the amount of virus in the sample with the extreme limit of detection, down to a single copy. This process occurs rapidly, within minutes, allowing the user to assess their treatment plan quickly after administration of the test.","The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, became a global pandemic in early March 2020. Worldwide, the virus has since killed nearly 1.5 million people and infected 64 million more. One of the key aspects to controlling the spread of the virus is to detect it early through testing and tracing infected individuals. Currently, there are not many diagnostic tests for COVID-19 that rapidly give an individual result. The most commonly available test is an RT-PCR test, results of which usually are not available for a couple of days. Rapid antigen tests are also available, however, its limit of detection and accuracy are not as good as RT-PCR.

This test resolves the issue of forcing a suspected infectious individual to quarantine and wait days for their test results while providing extreme limit of detection by providing results within minutes of the administration of the test. Not only does this rapid detection technology allow the individual to assess their treatment needs more quickly, but it also is precise and conveniently available through a user’s smartphone technology. If approved, this technology would be readily available to be scaled to thousands of on-site tests at a low cost.",Healthcare Portfolios
Sensor Signal Prediction at Unreported Frequencies,"The Internet of Things (IoT) systems are increasingly complex as people continually prefer more information and automation. This trend has been growing in manufacturing, home safety, and building automation. One of the major realities faced by IoT systems is an overwhelming amount of data coming from sensors. Not only that, but the cost of having all sensors constantly monitoring on all frequencies is very high. This technology is a step toward a cost-effective solution.","The Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and the data collected from there has increased dramatically over the past several years. And, while the number of sensors increase, the accuracy and versatility of sensor readings become more important. One of the problems associated with data collection accuracy is that processing large amounts of data is costly. And basic sensors may find it difficult to report wide ranges of frequencies which may therefore distort the reported data.

To more accurately assess the frequency data given from these sensors, this technology offers a way of predicting a more wholistic understanding of the data reported from IoT sensors from either unreported low or higher frequencies. This provides a way for those sensors to be more versatile and accurate.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Portable Deep Neural Network based Side Channel Attacks,This technology uses deep neural networks to examine the power states of a device performing cryptographic operations and determine the underlying encryption key with high accuracy across varying processor architectures.,"Embedded systems are among devices often the most vulnerable to attacks on their security. They are often used in public or in distributed environments where it becomes a challenge to prevent physical tampering. The Internet of Things has resulted in a dramatic increase in the prevalence embedded devices, many of which process sensitive information. And the rapid technological developments in the defense industry demand high levels of security for technologies used in the field.

One type of security threat particularly important to embedded devices are side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks use information about a system, such as power states, to infer other, more valuable information. While the concept of side channel attacks has existed since the turn of the millennium, recent developments in machine learning technology, as illustrated in a 2016 article, have dramatically improved the feasibility of such attacks.

This technology builds upon breakthroughs in side channel attack technology to create an attack method that can be used against devices with varying processor architectures, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Other side channel attack methods include waveform matching with Fourier analysis to improve correlation accuracy of power states and keys, targeting processor branch instructions, measuring keyboard acoustics for password detection, and measuring interrupt latency for coarse-grained information in even the most secure Intel commodity processors.

In addition to its potential offensive applications such as cyber warfare, it provides a valuable method of testing and verifying the security of embedded systems and their resistance to side channel attacks. For example, a research group detected cache-based side-channel attacks through identifying abnormal cache behaviors associated with those attacks. Side channel attack patents filed in the US in the past 5 years tend to concern defensive mechanisms to attacks (i.e. Intent patent US20190042479 A1 filed in 2018).",Engineering & Physical Sciences
"Lifelong Adaptive Neuronal Learning for Complete, Coverage Path Planning by an Autonomous Multi-Robot Team",This invention is an approach to neural networks solving both the human intervention problem and the power mitigation problem. Artificial Neural Tissue is a neural network with no centralized controller that allows a swarm of robots to cover a new area in near linear time. In this instance providing a solution to large spacecraft monitoring.,"UAVs, AUVs, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and swarm intelligence are the present and future of taking care of tasks difficult or expensive for humans to perform. And, as mankind branches into new zones like space, deep sea etc., it is not feasible for individuals to take care of many tasks like surveillance and testing required for exploration. 
And, while improvements seem to pour in daily, the idea of machine learning and swarm technology remain challenges to implement effectively and reliably. These become not only important, but necessary. Otherwise, one-to-one human control of the robots would be required which may solve problems of extreme conditions, but the necessity of a human controller sacrifices efficiency and progress.

Swarm technologies and machine learning algorithms sound like great solutions. The problem is most of these algorithms and groups of robots still require a central controller. In addition, there is a problem of efficiency of these robotic swarms: how does the swarm know when they are done? Can we cover an entire area without redundancies? These are the problems solved by this technology.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
TrustFlow,TrustFlow is a technology that enhances the security of systems based on the RISC-V architecture by protecting the integrity of sensitive data in memory.,"Embedded systems and the Internet of Things are becoming more and more commonplace. As these devices become ubiquitous and applied to more critical applications such as medical uses and autonomous transportation, the need for security is paramount.

First introduced in 2010, RISC-V is an open-sourced architecture for designing processors, with immense growth potential due to its capacity to be used by smaller companies that would otherwise have to purchase licenses or processors from the dominant semiconductor companies. But as a fairly new technology, there is still room to improve on the security of RISC-V solutions, especially in embedded applications.

This technology takes advantage of this opportunity by extending the RISC-V architecture in a manner that provides protection for sensitive data in memory while avoiding the addition of significant processing overhead that other state-of-the art solutions incur.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

BackGuard can integrate security into any type of embedded application written in C/C++.","Embedded systems are designed to perform a dedicated function or functions. Found in consumer electronics, process control systems, aircraft, in-car systems and many other applications, embedded systems need to be extremely reliable.

The firmware and security in embedded systems can be difficult (or impossible) to update, so in the past, such systems were often designed to have a life cycle of 15 years or more. With the growth of the internet of things (IoT), however, the nature of embedded systems is changing, and the number of possible attack vectors is growing exponentially. Many times, the security for embedded systems needs to be developed specifically for that system which can be a tedious process. BackGuard is very versatile which allows for security to be integrated into any type of embedded application written in C/C++.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Evaluating Hotels to Optimize Guest Sleep,"Excluding the exigent circumstances of 2020, the United States has approximately 4.9 million hotel rooms and, at any given time, approximately 3 million of those are occupied. The increased ability of people to travel all over the United States and the world is a trend that continues to rise. While hotels provide a number of amenities for guest comfort (i.e. WIFI, flat screens, entertainment etc.) is there a way to understand how well guests sleep in a given hotel? All of the other comforts are important, but customers are usually there to sleep. Is there a way to accurately track the sleep quality of a given hotel’s guests? This study is the first step to establishing a uniform standard for tracking sleep satisfaction and how sleep quality affects the overall customer satisfaction in a given hotel.","As established earlier, people travel more both for business and pleasure. And, in an era of online reviews, consumer sleep quality could be a million-dollar question for hotel owners. An easy way to increase satisfaction is to lower cost, increase room size, upgrade the mattress quality etc., but this is a business. Hotels, like any other industry are looking for the best possible return on investment.

Many websites and apps like Yelp, review hotels and allow consumers to do the same. But these ratings are somewhat arbitrary to hotel administrators. What is it that makes the overall satisfaction three stars instead of five? Are there simple measures to implement that would change the overall rating? This study suggests hotels can discern and make those changes.",Healthcare Portfolios

Poly Methyl Methacrylate/Room-Temperature Vulcanizing Silicone Rubber Bilayer for Enhancing the Long Term Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells,"This invention is a kind of encapsulation package and preparation method toward enhancing the outdoor stability of the perovskite solar cells. This perovskite solar cell with encapsulated bilayer retains more than 80% of the initial efficiency at the environmental condition of 50% moisture and 30°C temperature for more than 1,000 hours.","Perovskite solar cells represent an emerging category of thin film solar cells with very good prospects for becoming a replacement for not only other thin film solar technologies, but also as a substitute for crystalline silicon. Perovskite solar cells can be applied in more traditional fields, such as construction and utility projects, and in emerging, non-typical applications, such as artificial photosynthesis. Shortcomings of current designs are that they are unstable, have a short life span, and perovskite materials are sensitive to factors such as moisture, temperature, and oxygen. Perovskite solar cells with this encapsulated bilayer will be capable of enduring extreme outdoor temperatures for an extended period of time.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine - Integrative Telehealth Network,"Integrative health emphasizes a holistic, patient-focused approach to health care and wellness. Integrative medicine addresses a wide range of health influences, including physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental. This technology uses an integrative approach to medicine and provides a telehealth approach. The telehealth approach allows for the integrative healthcare to be distributed to patients via electronic information and telecommunication technologies.","Traditional western approaches to medicine often fall short when it comes to treating chronic illnesses in patients. On the other hand, a holistic, patient-centered approach has been shown to be effective to treat and prevent chronic illnesses and other health ailments because this integrative approach focuses on more than just the specific ailment at the time. Integrative medicine addresses the physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that affect an individual’s health, making it more apt to provide effective long-term solutions.
With the COVID-19 pandemic, access to healthcare has been difficult, due to closures of healthcare facilities and high capacities of sick patients, at a time when reliable access to healthcare is most important.

Formulations to Inhibit Hemotoxic Venoms,"This invention uses the chemical element of Ruthenium compounded with other chemical substances and in conjunction with a carbon monoxide releasing molecule (CORM-2) as an anti-venom against four different venoms from the genera Bothrops, Calloselasma, Echis, and Oxyuranus.","According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that around 5.4 million people are bitten by venomous snakes each year and at least 80,000 of those snake bites are lethal, with many more causing long-term health issues. Additionally, effective anti-venoms can be used to combat lizard or insect bites. Currently it is very expensive to treat venomous bites and many countries lack resources to create antivenins.

Most current antivenoms are derived from mammalian plasma and therefore include a risk of transmitting viruses from those animals. This technology instead uses the metal ruthenium, which has been discovered by the inventor to be a key substance in the anti-venom properties. Further, when using carbon monoxide releasing molecule compounds in conjunction with other Ruthenium compounds, the anti-venomous properties are enhanced to create a more effective antidote for venomous bites and stings.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Device for Automating Scientific Model Assembly from Text, Equations, and Software","This invention is a system that can construct and curate complex representations of scientific models by integrating three different sources of information. The three sources of information being natural language descriptions and technical documentation of models, model equations, and software used to implement the models.  All three sources of information require their own separate tools/software to translate the information into a single unified form.","Computational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics, and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied.
There exist today state-of-the-art computational models that can provide highly accurate predictions about complex phenomena such as crop growth and weather patterns. However, certain phenomena, such as food insecurity, involve a host of factors that cannot be modeled by any single one of these models, but which instead require the integration of multiple models.
This system will facilitate the integration of computational models from different domains which will allow for modeling large, complicated systems that span multiple domains and levels of abstraction. This effort will enable automated model composition and reasoning in context to directly support the development of ‘third wave’ artificial intelligence.",Research Tools
Predictive Modeling of People Movement and Disease Spread on Campus under COVID and Pandemic Situations,"A lack of information is perhaps the crux of every problem involving public policy. In 2020, COVID-19 emphasizes the lack of data and information with which public figures attempt to make decisions. Ideally, public policy, including policy for large institutions, would be made with a crystal ball and 100% certainty of the effects of the policy. Because this is impossible, simulations try to iterate and propagate key assumptions over time.","Computer models are used in applications like tensile-strength modeling of a steel beam to fluid modeling of biohazardous material in a given scenario. All of these computer models are run for the same reason: it is too expensive to run the experiment physically. This is true for COVID-19 and other diseases; the human cost and organizational cost is too expensive.

It is imperative that administrators and policy makers are not ignorant to the effects of their policy decisions, nor should they be paralyzed because the effects of that paralysis may be equally deadly. Accurate models give those policy makers a reasonable glimpse of potential policy outcomes. There is a large need for these models in many areas and, in 2020, this could be the difference between locking down forever and changing input parameters to get people back where they need to be. While there are many models considering crowd control or disease transmission, this model integrates all of the data available to the university to provide a holistic presentation of campus reactions to policy changes.",Software & Information Technology
Biomarker for Patient Stratification for Treatment of Cognitive Impairment in Patients with Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment,This technology has found a serum biomarker that is efficacious in stratifying patients with vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD). This biomarker was able to indicate patients with high levels of VCID that are well suited for treatment with angiotensin peptides.,"Worldwide, an estimated 50 million people are living with some form of dementia but much is still unknown its causes, how to properly diagnose it, and especially how to treat it. Research through clinical studies is therefore imperative to begin to understand this disorder that affects so many people. This technology allows for patients to be selected for clinical studies based on the prevalence of the biomarker in their plasma. Blood biomarkers, when proven effective for detection of a certain disease, are an easy method for determining whether an individual meets the requirements for a certain study of that disease. Because this biomarker helps to select better candidates for the clinical study, the researchers are able to more effectively create a treatment for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment dementia (VCID).",Life Sciences
Multiplexed Computed Tomography X-ray Imaging,This invention presents novel multiplexed measurement designs that improve X-ray CT imaging system’s performance. An imaging fidelity metric is employed to optimize multiplex measurement design. This considers the next generation Rectangular-Fixed-Gantry (RFG) CT system architecture containing several X-ray sources and detector arrays deployed in a fixed geometry. Such an RFG CT system architecture affords us the opportunity to explore non-standard multiplex measurement designs employing simultaneous illumination from multiple sources. The goal of the multiplexed measurement design is to minimize the bag reconstruction error.,"X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) based systems are widely used for security and industrial inspection applications like passenger baggage and cargo screening at the airports, shipping container screening at ports, and industrial parts inspection. Typically, such CT systems employ a mechanical rotating gantry, with a X-ray source and detector array(s), to collect a large number of angularly diverse projections scans of an object. However, such a mechanical scanning mechanism adds to the system cost and maintenance.

This invention with optimized multiplexed measurement designs can significantly outperform the sequential measurement design employed in a traditional RFG CT system.",Imaging & Optics
Compact Snapshot Dual-Mode Interferometric System,This technology is an interferometric system that measures both surface shape and roughness and is designed for on-machine metrology.,"Interferometry uses constructive and destructive interference in waves to obtain information. One common application of this field is to examine the properties of a surface, often at nanoscale. When mounted on machines, interferometers enable manufacturing at extreme levels of precision.
Dual-mode inferometers use two different types of light to look at a surface and either measure the shape of a surface or its roughness depending upon the type of light used. However, existing dual-mode interferometers are unable to freely change between modes. This technology solves the problem by combining both surface shape and roughness measurement into one compact interferometric system and eliminates the need to reconfigure the system when switching between surface shape and roughness modes.",Imaging & Optics
Efficient All-Fiber Amplifier based on Small Diameter Air Clad Fibers,This technology is a novel fiber amplifier that achieves high efficiency while reducing cladding thickness.,"Optical fiber communications are in high demand and expected to continue to grow at a fast pace in the near future. As companies compete to take advantage of this market opportunity, there is a drive to continuously improve the efficiency of optical communications. One area with room for innovation is optical amplifiers.

Signals traveling over fiber optic cables attenuate over distance, requiring amplification to travel longer distances. Optical amplifiers like this technology boost a fiber optic signal without needing to first convert it back into an electrical signal. This technology improves on other similar amplifiers by allowing for smaller diameter cladding to conserve space, without sacrificing efficiency of amplification.",Imaging & Optics
Replication Method for Volume Holographic Optical Elements and Holographic Waveguide Couplers,This invention is a replication method for volume holographic optical elements and waveguide couplers. It is a new configuration for fabricating transmission holograms using composite master holograms and reflection holograms using a pair of master holograms. It produces a method that is scalable and able to increase the type of waveguide holograms that can be fabricated. This invention has the potential for commercial application in augmented reality displays and solar energy systems. This method utilizes successful replication techniques from prism-coupled assemblies without the drawbacks of limited spatial frequencies in those systems.,"Volume Holographic Optical Elements (VHOE) are a type of diffractive optical elements with applications in solar energy, display systems, security, and medical imaging. Holographic optical elements (HOE) can be classified into two main types, thin and volume. Historically, VHOEs have been used in customizable applications, but this application is becoming more commercially available as technology matures. Manufacturability still lags development so improvements to ease manufacturing are valuable to process efficiently an increased commercial demand.

Currently, contact-copy is the main manufacturing process. It uses a master hologram that creates copies of itself through contact with a photopolymer. However, this process is not well suited to input beams that are non-planar or when apertures of the VHOE need to be well-defined. A prism-coupled technique used total internal reflection of beams to create replication holograms without these limitations, yet the technique required an air gap between the master hologram assembly and replication hologram, which prevented the production of waveguide holograms because the air gap limited spatial frequencies of the interference pattern created by the object and reference beams.",Imaging & Optics
Interleaved Multi-Pass Optical Amplifier,"This invention is a multi-pass master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA). The technology is an optical amplifier, such as a laser amplifier, that has been configured so the signal cycles through the gain media multiple times. The goal of this is to better saturate the available power from the gain and greatly decrease the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE).","In standard oscillators, the nonlinear effect causes limitations in the output peak power and pulse energy. There is a need for a product that allows for the oscillator to have a high-output peak and pulse energy. In applications where the signal to be amplified is pulsed and the pulses are accompanied with unwanted preceding components such as an ASE, the preceding components can saturate the gain and effectively reduce the available power to the main component of the pulse.",Imaging & Optics
Smartphone-Based Multispectral Dermascope,"A rise in melanoma cases across the world and a decline in the number of dermatological specialists characterizes the outlook of global professional skin care. General practitioners can look for clues before referring patients to a specialist; and, if they have the tools, they can take high-quality diagnostic tests for further specialist monitoring. However, specialized equipment is expensive and unrealistic for family practices to carry.","In the United States, between 17,000 and 18,000 people die from skin cancer every year and over 64,000 in the world. Early detection is a key contributor to the 5-year survival rate in individuals diagnosed with skin cancer. Because early-detection can make all the difference, companies have been trying to educate the public about the dangers of skin cancer, and make early-detection as easy as possible.
Several phone apps allow individuals to send pictures to specialists to analyze. However, the information is often not enough for a diagnosis. In addition, there are many people in the United States and around the world who don’t have access to a specialist. General practitioners would be more successful at diagnosing malignant forms of cancer with the right tools. Unfortunately, the right tools are often too expensive and unrealistic for a local clinic to have on-hand.
This invention changes the way professionals collect information on suspicious areas. Pew research found that 81% of Americans have smartphones and that number is increasing rapidly. So, while it is unrealistic to expect general practitioners to have specialized skin cancer screening equipment, it would be realistic to expect most people to have smart phones. There are many health screening apps and this dermascope attachment to any cell phone would vastly improve the data sent to doctors from patients around the world.",Imaging & Optics
Protein Structure Analysis using One-Step Tyrosine Conjugation,"This invention includes methods and systems for detecting, comparing, or evaluating proteins in an folded conformation, a particular bound state, or an aggregate state, and methods and systems for comparing amounts of labeling of a protein in a natural or control conformation and a denatured conformation. The methods of this invention may be used for a variety of applications including but not limited to evaluation of protein aggregates levels related to a particular disease (e.g., aggregate-associated disease, etc.), for study of disease progression, drug development for therapeutics at various stages of disease progression, or for diagnostic purposes.","Current standards of proteopathy disease diagnoses, such as El Escorial criteria for ALS, lack sensitivity and are unable to quantify disease progression. Lack of tools to evaluate disease progression may limit therapeutic development and opportunities for effective clinical application. The novel technology presented here addresses these issues by increasing the sensitivity and reliability of detecting structural proteopathies.",Healthcare Portfolios
Refractive Index Contrast Polymer Photonics Interconnects and Waveguides for Packaging and Integration,"This invention represents a new chemical composition of photoresponsive, polymer photoresists, where the refractive index of the polymer can be modulated via UV radiation to facilitate the arbitrary writing of optical waveguides and other photonic devices in the material. The material can be spun on to any substrate or existing photonic device architecture and, through lithography, create polymer waveguides and enable interconnecting of individual silicon integrated photonics chips, functioning as an inexpensive optical interconnect medium. The ability to transfer an optical signal between waveguide devices is critical in the formation of optical printed circuit boards, which can provide faster processing and potentially lower cost than traditional electric printed circuit boards. Optical interconnections can be directly written to connect spatially separated waveguides using maskless lithography. The material composition leads to low optical propagation loss at telecommunications wavelengths such as 1310nm and 1550nm.","A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) integrates one or more optical components, such as modulators, lasers, detectors, multiplexers and demultiplexers, attenuators and optical amplifiers, into a system. Large-scale PICs, like their large-scale electronic counterparts, may have complex organization, requiring effective interconnections for desired system performance. Next generation photonic devices have ever increasing needs for accelerated methods to fabricate waveguiding elements and optical interconnects. In particular, polymer waveguides play an important role as optical interconnects facilitating incorporation of silicon photonics elements into the electronic processing framework, which is the new paradigm for fulfilling the demand on data centers and high performance computing. Hence, there is a compelling need to simplify and streamline polymer waveguide fabrication techniques which require spatial control of refractive index (RI, or n). While extensive efforts in polymer science have focused on methods to prepare optically transparent, high RI polymers, the creation of photoresponsive polymers, where the refractive index can be spatially defined in planar thin films to create refractive index contrast is a distinct technical challenge requiring a new class of RI-tunable materials.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
"Reconfigurable Entanglement-Enhanced Microwave Photonic Sensors for Navigation, Imaging, and Communications",This technology uses multipartite entanglement to enhance the sensitivity of microwave photonic sensors. These photonic sensors are comprised of electro-optic modulators that convert the microwave signal into an electric field displacement at a sideband frequency. Measurements that are made by the sensor nodes use this multipartite entanglement to improve performance and accuracy.,"This invention describes a way to enhance sensitivity of photonic sensors that use entangled photons for communication. Here, using electro-optic modulators enhances the RF-to-Photon conversion. Quantum sensing using photons is a rather new field and this method is a way to improve accuracy and sensitivity of photonic sensors. Photonic sensors are used for measurement and imaging at a range of distances from nanometers to using it to look at stars. This method will improve resolution and accuracy and allow for broader applications of a newer technology.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Open Source Software as a Service for Solar Forecast Evaluation,"The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source evaluation platform for solar forecasting. The platform enables evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable, and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter is designed to support all solar forecasting stakeholders.","A major concern surrounding solar power is the variability and unpredictability of sunlight. This inherent variability poses issues with grid reliability and the expenses associated with operating the solar units. Errors in solar forecast accuracy arise either from the weather prediction or PV simulation step. Forecasting is just one part of the puzzle – “what next” is the key issue. If one deviates from the forecast, should they be penalized, and by how much? These are key issues. There is inherently a limit to perfection in forecasting; however, tools are improving, so average errors decreasing and the time-periods of confidence are improving as well.
The Solar Forecast Arbiter is a technology that will allow for evaluation of solar forecasts to evaluate methods and practices used to develop the forecasts. The technology includes a data validation toolkit, reference data sources, data privacy protocols, and benchmark forecast capabilities for intra-hour and day ahead forecast horizons to improve upon current solar forecasting software.",Software & Information Technology
We Health Arizona - COVID personal management app,"This is a mobile app available at <a href=""https://www.wehealth.org/arizona"">https://www.wehealth.org/arizona</a>.","Bluetooth attenuation has been validly used as a way to determine distances between devices for the past several years. However, there are variables that make the calculation difficult and inaccurate. For example, the orientation of the device relative to the other, receiver strength, emission power, etc. All of these variables must be taken into account to pinpoint the distances between individuals. This is relevant because COVID-19 contact tracing apps are generally looking for individuals who stay within 6 feet of each other for over 15 minutes.
Additionally, the probability of infection from COVID-19 depends largely on the “shedding rate” of the individual who has tested positive. Furthermore, the risk of having COVID-19 will decrease with each day that goes by without testing positive. This study personalizes the quarantine length and advises the user of their risk depending on all of the aforementioned variables.",Healthcare Portfolios
DASH-WELL A Near Real-Time Geographic Information System-Based Tool for Emotion Mapping in the Built Environment,"“The unprecedented circumstances surrounding COVID-19” was the pervasive buzz phrase of 2020 and post-COVID re-entry in 2021. More than ever before, businesses, universities, congregations, and communities are seeking ways to allay people’s fears, anxieties, and stress as they re-enter their workplaces and communities and come back to something that resembles normalcy.","Lack of information about safety risks and comfort of places causes stress and anxiety for those entering those spaces, especially in the context of viral risk. Public and private policies for large groups of people are created, in large part, based on the idea of risk and reward. The multi-variable analysis required for assessing risk lacks the necessary variables. For example, number of people in certain locations, ventilation in specific buildings, number of people social distancing or wearing masks, etc. And, even if that information is collectible, there is a large time gap between collecting the information and assessing the information.

This is a solution to the real time information gap. Real time risk assessment for those who make policy and for those who are on campus weighing their own risk and reward. This allows people to make the decisions that are right for them. Much like applications that allow drivers to chart a path around events like accidents, this dashboard allows individuals to chart their path around risky situations, and therefore mitigating risk for individuals and groups alike.",Healthcare Portfolios
Brief Index of Sleep Control (BRISC),"This is a diagnostic index and questionnaire that assesses the degree to which an individual perceives control over their bedtime, wake time, sleep duration, and sleep quality.","Control over time to bed, time awake, sleep duration, and sleep quality are all related to sleep outcomes and assessment of these constructs may be useful for future sleep interventions. Modern societies are now facing challenges in achieving adequate sleep and experiencing a variety of sleep disturbances. This technology allows a health care professional to determine various aspects of a person’s sleep patterns and quality of sleep which would enhance the determination of appropriate treatment. This could be very useful for sleep research purposes.
Of a total population of 325 million Americans, 58% are estimated to experience insomnia symptoms or sleep disorders. As obesity rates climb and Americans age, more people are developing sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome and other sleep disorders.

This invention may use real-time ECG signals to provide clinical decision support to health care providers in the form of a web or mobile application.  This technology can enable a faster and more reliable method of reading ECGs and help screen and identify important image features that require expert scrutiny.","Deep learning has gained significant attention as a subset of machine learning with significant investments in research over the last few years. Deep learning is an advanced type of artificial neural networks. This technology largely emulates the human brain by learning and solving complex problems, which may be applied to the interpretation of ECG signals where resources in trained ECG experts and/or health care reimbursement are limited. Deep learning is currently the fastest growing segment of artificial intelligence due to its ability to extract information from unstructured data.",Healthcare Portfolios
Algorithm and Software for a Quantum Molecular Non-Born-Oppenheimer Model to Predict Molecular Interactions with a Magnetic Field,This invention is an algorithm developed and implemented for a new non-Born-Oppenheimer method for atomic quantum-mechanical calculations to predict fine structure corresponding to atomic transitions for atoms or molecules in a strong magnetic field. This algorithm was programmed and tested in calculations of hydrogen deuteride (HD) in a stationary magnetic field. The splitting of the HD singlet and triplet energy levels were studied. This advancement involves using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions with shifted centers to represent the wave function dependent on the spatial coordination of the electrons and the nuclei. The work involved high-accuracy calculations performed with the use of supercomputers.,"Computer simulation to rationalize and predict the behavior and course of atoms and molecules in chemical and materials systems has been of critical importance in the chemical and allied industries for several decades. The advent of supercomputers and parallel processing has opened the door further for accurate predictions of chemical behavior which could previously only been usefully interrogated with empirical methods.

Non-Invasive Monitoring of the Autonomic Nervous System for Real-Time Assessment of Human Stress,"This innovative research uses video thermography and a novel algorithm designed to analyze changes in sweat pore activation (SPA). This technology can rival pupillometry in understanding physiological responses under various stresses and circumstances. This is a real-time, non-invasive way to detect sweat pores’ response to stimuli, both physical and emotional. In society today, mental health is acknowledged perhaps more than any other time, as universally important to an individual’s health. Physiological markers accompany certain disorders, for example PTSD, but those markers are difficult to measure or evaluate. This technology can improve how professionals evaluate some of those physiological markers.","The <a href=""https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/ptsd/what-is-ptsd"">American Psychiatric Association</a> claim that 3.5% of American adults suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but only 11 people are diagnosed. As a society, we are understanding the effects of mental health problems on concrete physiological responses to the human body. The novel steps in this technology allow for a new way to evaluate stressors like PTSD in, for example, candidates for positions where understanding of one’s mental or emotional stressors are required.

Furthermore, in the realm of professional and amateur athletics, athletes would have the ability to test their response to emotional and physical stressors and adjust accordingly. While other methods of evaluating the Automatic Nervous System (ANS) exist, they can be difficult to operationalize and often require wearing multiple sensors and complicated equipment. This method frees the individual from those inconveniences, allows the user or researcher to test a wide variety of situations, and does so in a non-invasive manner.

Aside from improving athletic performance and screening for appropriate candidates, there is a growing market for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. This study explored the possibility of identifying physical markers, such as sweat gland response, to physical and emotional stimuli to perhaps indicate triggers for PTSD. There is a research grant market, and a market for healthcare treatment of these conditions. This technology fills the need for innovative and versatile ways for detecting stressors and treating individuals who suffer from disorders like PTSD.",Life Sciences
Laser Beam for External Position Control and Traffic Management of On-Orbit Satellites,"This invention is a satellite control system. The system consists of a customized “smart skin” containing solar panels, power and control circuitry, and an embedded secondary propulsion system. A laser is used from a ground station or another spacecraft and is beamed towards the satellite. The satellite has onboard photovoltaics that act as a wake-up laser receiver. This approach enables a laser ground station or a spacecraft to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency that would trigger operation of the secondary propulsion system to perform impulse maneuvers, altitude control maneuvers, and corrections.","This technology offers several benefits over existing techniques, such as low initial investment, low power usage, high bandwidth, and high security. The “over-congestion” of key satellite orbits greatly decreases their utility, as collisions become far more likely. Adding an actuated reflector to the spacecraft will enable laser ranging and two-way communication between ground station and the spacecraft, in a secure manner not currently available to RF communication systems. There is a need to develop secondary and backup systems to effectively move these satellites and perform traffic management of derelict satellites so that collision risks are minimized or eliminated.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
"Blocking NRP-1 for the Treatment of Pain, Cancer and Prevention of Viral Entry","This invention discloses a novel method for the treatment of pain and cancer as well as the prevention of viral entry, most notably SARS-CoV-2. The inventors have identified a number of promising lead compounds which bind to and interrupt neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) signaling. This is an important first step in the development of small molecule inhibitors that could not only be used to treat neuropathic pain and cancer, but also serve as a preventative measure against SARS-CoV-2 virus entry.","COVID-19, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to infect millions of people worldwide and no therapeutic has been made commercially available as of yet. One promising therapeutic approach would be to inhibit neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) signaling, as there is evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway in order to gain viral entry into cells. Additionally, NRP-1 has also been a long-time focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer treatment and represents a novel target for treating neuropathic pain as well. Thus targeting the inhibition of NRP-1 would not only be an innovative method for preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, but would also be advantageous in the treatment pain and cancer.",Life Sciences

Allosteric Modulators of TDP-43 for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases,"This invention is a small molecule drug, nTRD22, that can be used to treat currently incurable neurodegenerative diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and potentially even Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This molecule targets the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and causes allosteric modulation of the RRM of TDP-43, allowing for a new way to modulate RNA binding domains (RRM1 and RRM2) and target RNA-protein interactions in neurogenerative diseases. Specifically, the nTRD22 compound, and its further derivatives, can be utilized to target the NTD of TDP-34 and disrupt the dimerization of TPD-43.","Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are among the top 10 most fatal incurable diseases. As the global population ages, the incidence of these diseases will continue to increase. Current drugs targeting these diseases can slow progression and reduce the severity of the disease’s symptoms, but they are not extremely effective at doing so, and none are able to cure the disease permanently.
 
The present invention offers an alternative approach of targeting the NTD of TDP-43, which is a critical factor in several neurodegenerative diseases, involved in RNA metabolism.

Tracheostomy Positioning Device,This invention is a mechanism to assist in the positioning for a tracheostomy to open the windpipe. This technology results in precise external localization of where the tracheotomy incision should be made.,"Tracheotomy is one of the oldest procedures known to mankind. It is a medical procedure in which a tracheostomy, an opening in the windpipe, is surgically created to allow for breathing to occur through a breathing tube. Currently, tracheostomies are placed by palpitating the skin, but it is easier and more accurate to use internal features of the airway to place the tracheostomy appropriately. More than 12,000 tracheostomies are inserted annually in the UK alone, and up to 20% of patients in ICU are managed with a tracheostomy.

New Device for Electropolmeric Paving and Sealing,"A device for electropolymeric paving has been developed by researchers at the University of Arizona. This device includes a biocompatible implantable degradable polymeric material having integrated electrical properties useful for sensing or detecting one or more analytes, signals or conditions, transmitting or generating a signal, or releasing a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic agent. The integrated electric component of the implant can locally monitor and/or modify the function of an organ or organ component.","The complications associated with current permanent implants such as coronary stents results from both the biocompatibility of the chosen material and the biocompatibility of the implant architecture, i.e. the inherent design deficiencies in the stenting devices. The stent is a foreign object (not native to the body), it incites an immune response which may cause scar tissue (cell proliferation) to rapidly grow over the stent. In addition, there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the site where the stent damages the arterial wall. Lastly, the size and/or structure of the stent may give rise to mechanical stability problems as the stent is much stiffer than the surrounding arteries. Therefore, there is a need in the current medical industry to provide materials and methods for forming smart biomedical implants on endoluminal surfaces without the need for invasive medical procedures, and which have the potential to biodegrade over the lifetime of the implant.",Life Sciences
All-Reflective Microscope,This invention is an innovative all-reflective microscope with off-axis configuration with freeform surface. This design would have uniform diffraction limit performance from UV to far-IR.,"Reflecting microscopes, which incorporate reflecting rather than refracting objectives, are used for imaging over a wide range of wavelengths, especially in the ultraviolet and infrared regions in which conventional optical glasses do not transmit light. Typical applications include the identification of micro-contamination in commercial products or processes, the characterization of trace evidence in forensic investigations and the investigation of the chemical morphology of materials.
The reflecting objective generally consists of two components, namely, a relatively large, concave primary mirror and a smaller, convex secondary mirror. The secondary mirror is situated between the primary mirror and the object and serves to relay the image from the primary mirror to the focal plane of the eyepiece. One disadvantage of the reflecting microscope is that the secondary mirror causes a small obstruction in the center of the eyepiece. The shape of the pupil is annular, with out-of-focus blurs having unusual shapes because of the obstruction.
This microscope will have all the advantages of current refractive and reflective microscopes, but without their limitations.",Imaging & Optics

Development of Aptamers Neutralizing Antibodies for Demyelinating Diseases,"This innovation is research involving the development of aptamers that work to neutralize antibodies which harm the myelin sheath of nerves. The innovation can be a successful treatment for both multiple sclerosis (MS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD). These aptamers will be very specific to block certain autoantibodies and can be designed to have specific aptamer panels for each patient depending on what autoantibodies they have. The current treatments for these auto-immune diseases are non-specific and only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems of the symptoms. The technology has the potential to provide a personalized approach for patients by neutralizing one of the pathologic components of the autoimmune reaction that causes demyelination.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease which affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is one of many which affects the central nervous system and is currently without a cure. Without a cure, medical research focuses on treatment for MS and trying to make life more manageable for those suffering from the debilitating disease. Aptamers are small single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotide fragments or small peptides, which can bind to targets. One of the problems with MS treatment is antibodies attacking the myelin sheath of the body’s nerves. With the amount of money that people spend every year on multiple sclerosis treatment, there is a need for a development of a treatment which gives patients the life they deserve.",Life Sciences
Targeting TDP-43 for Parkinson's Disease Therapy,"This invention is a molecule that targets the aberrant aggregation of a certain protein (TDP-43, associated with neurodegeneration) of neurons. The molecule binds to a specific site within the TDP-43 protein, and this helps prevent the unwanted aggregation of TDP-43 within neurons. The molecule has been shown to stop and even reverse neurodegeneration in experimental models.","Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people globally. Currently, most treatments for these diseases only include treating symptoms and not the root causes of the disease. In the past 10 years, a corollary component of neurodegenerative diseases has been identified as the RNA transcribing related protein TDP-43. This protein plays an important role in cellular functions but can become a problem when many of these proteins aggregate within a neuron, forming insoluble masses. Many types of neurodegeneration have been shown to have problematic TDP-43 proteinopathy involved including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease) Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.",Life Sciences
Photonic Machine Learning with Wavelength/Frequency Multiplexing,This invention is an improved method of machine learning utilizing nanophotonic devices to implement neural networks. Photons from nanophotonic devices have degrees of freedom which allow for more information to be encoded in the photons. This allows the neural network to be expanded. Signals then are encoded in different wavelengths which allow for many signals to be transmitted in a single signal that must be decoded with a similar technology. This method works best for convolutional neural networks where the same set of operations is repeatedly applied to different data.,"Machine learning currently is limited by the size of the neural network being worked with. This method allows for the neural network to be expanded which allows for a more efficient machine learning method. Wavelength multiplexing allows for multiple signals to be encoded in multiple wavelengths which increases the volume of data that can be processed in a time period. Machine learning is often very intense on computing and it takes a long time to build a neural network. With this invention, the computing time and power will be decreased, and it will be made more efficient and effective in the long run.",Imaging & Optics
Plastic Pollution Cleanup in the Ocean,"This invention is a specially designed hydrocyclone, a type of cyclonic separator, that is meant to separate plastics from water. It is designed in such a way that it can filter plastics smaller than 5mm in size while returning nutrients, like plankton, back to the ocean.","Every year up to 8,00,000 metric tons of plastic enters our planet's oceans where it collects in circulating currents, known as gyres, or is carried to beaches. While floating, the plastic pieces break down from environmental factors like the sun and animals into smaller and smaller pieces, some of which measure a fraction of a millimeter. These pieces are then small enough to enter the food chain where they can eventually be found in the seafood we consume. When consumed, the plastic can cause deformities in DNA and can lead to illnesses like cancer. Floating plastic also contributes to oceanic dead zones, areas that lack life because oxygen or food is being affected by something in the system. Removing plastic from the ocean has become critical to its health and the survival of the animals that live in and around it.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
"Photochemically Stable, Non-Leaching, Bridged Polysilsesquioxane Based Sunscreens","This technology is a non-toxic, long-lasting sun protection based on nanoparticles of bridged polysilsesquioxanes.","UV radiation (100 – 400 nm) represents ~10% of electromagnetic radiation (sunlight) that reaches the Earth's surface, and can be separated into three main types: UVC (100 – 290 nm), which has the shortest wavelength and highest energy; UVB (290 – 320 nm); and UVA (320 – 400 nm), which has the longest wavelength and lowest energy. UVB has traditionally been thought to be the most harmful radiation to skin, and the prevalence of UVB absorbing active ingredients in commercial sunscreens has reflected this belief. Recent studies, however, have detailed the harmful effects of UVA exposure as well, for sufficient doses of UVA, particularly UVA-II, can in fact induce sunburn. While the sunburn potential of UVA is less than that of UVB, exposure to lower energy UVA over a prolonged period will result in the same degree of sunburn as exposure to higher energy UVB for a shorter period of time.
 
Interestingly, due to the deeper penetration depth of UVA in skin, increased absorption of UVA in persons protected with sunscreens that only filter UVB, and in turn extended hours in the sun without the warning of sunburn, UVA has been found to be the major contributor of accelerated skin aging. For this reason, commercial sunscreen formulations are increasingly including active ingredients to attenuate UVA radiation. To mitigate UV exposure, the use of sunscreens, which contain active ingredients that block UV, is recommended.",Healthcare Portfolios

Convolutional Neural Networks for Pavement Roughness Assessment Using Calibration-Free Vehicle Dynamics,"This technology is a method of identifying road roughness (i.e., International roughness index, IRI) by collecting sensor data from a smartphone app or other computing device and applying deep learning techniques to estimate the road’s roughness index.","Monitoring of road surface conditions is a logistical challenge. Traditionally, road condition monitoring for maintenance and repair relied on driver reporting and expensive and infrequent comprehensive surveys. As a result, roadway condition data tended to be poor quality and out of date. Recent alternative solutions have made use of smartphone sensor information to automatically provide road condition information in a fast and cost-effective manner. However existing solutions suffer from either a lack of accuracy, the need for mounting extra sensors to the axle of vehicles, or calibration of the tool to provide validated baselines to compare with.

Dynamic Capacitance Sensor Board Development,This technology is a new sensor board that converts dynamic capacitance in a sensor into an analog voltage signal. The signal created by this sensor board can then be used with any off-the-shelf wired or wireless data acquisition system.,"Sensors are increasingly used for structural monitoring. For example, networks of hundreds of strain-measuring sensors can be attached to large structures such as bridges, to analyze their performance in real time and identify potential problems with greater accuracy than visual inspection.

Existing technologies typically make use of sensor elements that detect strain by changing their electrical resistive properties in the presence of changes in strain. However, these sensors have limited effectiveness in larger structures because each individual sensor can only measure a small area, often requiring expensive arrays of sensor elements to cover a larger area.

Capacitive strain sensors offer the promise of covering larger areas. But existing capacitive sensing solutions do not provide the level of sensitivity to make them feasible in monitoring strain on larger steel structures. This technology solves this problem, detecting minute strain deformations at a high sampling rate.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Molten Salts for Precious Metal Recovery,"This invention is a method used primarily for mining that extracts metals using electrodeposition from a mixture of refined ore and molten salt in order to reduce the melting point. Much like the process of extracting aluminum from Bauxite, gold is extracted from ore using electrodeposition as a replacement for the widely used sodium cyanide mixture.","Mining for precious metals like gold, silver, and copper fuel economies across the world. These metals are very commonplace--all of the major technology used on a daily basis requires these precious metals in some capacity. However, the state of mining technology relies heavily on cyanide in the United States and mercury and cyanide throughout the world. The health problems that stem from using poisonous mixtures are prevalent throughout the world in the environment and the surrounding populations.
This technology is a replacement for both heap leaching and vat leaching for mercury and cyanide. Using molten salts and electrodeposition allows the mining industry to transition from the poisonous processes of the past, for a more efficient, environmentally friendly process for the future. Furthermore, this process in some cases increases the amount of metal extracted from the ore. While cyanide typically recovers about 90% of precious metals after several rounds of leaching, molten salt treatment as described here recovers between 90 and 98%.
 
A similar process is used in extracting aluminum from Bauxite and has been extremely effective in that field. This technological step forward is to lower the required mixture temperature thus decreasing energy costs and making the idea more plausible for companies to adopt.
 
Not only is this technology environmentally and morally responsible, but economically efficient. Mining is essential for the lives of people across the globe. Equally essential are those who work in refineries and those who live around these mining practices. This technology can be the future of the industry and a more responsible and efficient step forward.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

Solar Tower to Dry Food Waste on a Large Scale,"This invention is an innovative greenhouse designed to dry food waste at scale. This radical design maximizes the temperature gradient within the tower to minimize drying time. The solar dryer uses solar radiation, requiring minimal energy input. The dried food waste can be stored and used as needed to fertilize fields, feed livestock, or it can be sold as a commodity, turning a waste stream into a revenue stream.","In the United States alone, a staggering 62.1 billion pounds of fruit, vegetable, and grain waste end up in the landfill each year. This amounts to an economic loss of $75.5 billion. The biggest constraint on salvaging this food waste is time: food waste needs to be processed before it rots. More modern use of greenhouses to increase drying rate typically have a single layer of drying plant material at bench or ground height. This is adequate for small batches of agricultural produce, but not sufficient to handle large-scale drying. Industrial scale food drying technology using drum-dryers or spray-dryers are fast but require huge energy inputs and are cost prohibitive. 
This design for a solar dryer will allow large-scale drying of agricultural waste or manure that can be stored for later use as livestock feed or fertilizer. Evaporated water can be reclaimed and used for irrigation or other needs. The dryer will enable large scale repurposing of food waste, generate income from waste, reduce landfill usage, and reclaim water with a minimal input of energy.",Agriculture & Horticulture
High Performance UV Disinfection in a HVAC System with Integrated Concentrator Optics,This invention is an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) system that disinfects air through ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation.

Improved Performance of Li-S Batteries via Sulfur Copolymers Cathodes: Plasticization of Cathodes,"This invention is a novel cathode composite design based on molybdenum sulfide particles dispersed within a conductive sulfur polymer backbone, prepared with vinylic comonomers, such as diisobutadiene (DIB). The polysulfide provides high conductivity and stable, robust chemistry in a tuneable and simple 2-D design. Capacities of 500 to more than 1,000 mAh/g have been achieved after many charge/discharge cycles for various compositions.","Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been heavily researched, due to theoretical advantages of high capacity and energy density by weight, improved safety compared to lithium-ion batteries, low cost, and the potential to enable mass market transportation applications. However, barriers to achieving this promise include limited cycle lifetimes, large capacity fading, the low conductivity of sulfur, and complicated proposed solutions to overcome these challenges. A solution is needed to prevent cathode degradation during cycling with a simple cathode design that can be further optimized.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Serological Assays for SARS-CoV-2,University of Arizona researchers have developed a serological assay to test for prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The technology uses a two-step protocol to maximize the specificity of the assay and reduce false positives.,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, China. Since that time, this virus has spread worldwide, impacting everything from individual lives to the worldwide economy. The virus affected people in different ways. Some individuals had severe symptoms, leading to hospitalization or death, while other patients experienced no symptoms at all. This has led to many people wondering if they have been exposed to the virus. 

While antibody-based tests have been developed, the largest issue to date is a high rate of false positives. This leads to skewed analytics and an incorrect belief of immunity in individuals who have a false positive result.

High Bandwidth Positive Displacement Reversible Pump/Motor,"This invention is a pump system developed to serve as an artificial heart. This is an electrically driven device without fixed valves that functions with ""functional equivalents"" of valves via a sliding vane. The vane serves to propel flow as well as to partition flow. A high bandwidth positive displacement reversible pump/motor with two embodiments is proposed.","More than 5 million Americans have heart failure, with 670,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as ventricular assist devices (VADs) and total artificial heart (TAH), have emerged as approved frontline therapy, providing restoration of failing circulation, as either a bridge to transplantation, or an alternative to transplantation as destination therapy. While MCS is vital and effective in restoring hemodynamics, sadly, more than 70% of implanted MCS patients require re-hospitalization within one year of implant due to thrombosis and/or bleeding. Additionally, infection from device bulk and exiting drivelines is a major limitation as well.

Most current MCS devices are either piston-cylinder-like positive displacement architectures (SynCardia, Carmat, Berlin Heart) with valves to direct flow directions or fast spinning turbine or centrifugal architectures. The proposed invention architectures are able to generate the same amount of required flow rate with a more compact size and at a dramatically reduced speed due to its positive displacement feature. The reduced speed would lead to lower shear stress on blood and lower blood damage. As positive displacement architectures, valves are eliminated, thus reducing valve-related blood damage.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Imaging Human Respiratory Gas Patterns, Volume, Rate and Carbon Dioxide","This invention is a multi-camera-based system that can produce 3-dimensional (3D) images of human respiratory gas patterns, volume, rate and carbon dioxide (CO2) content through two complementary imaging techniques, combined with 3D computerized models of gas flow.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication in patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary disease that can manifest shortly after the onset of difficulty breathing. As ARDS onset can occur very quickly after the appearance of mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, it is essential to have a means to monitor and quickly identify respiratory decline before it reaches a critical level.
Current evaluation of respiratory distress and failure uses cumbersome and relatively invasive pulmonary function tests (e.g. spirometry, lung volume, lung diffusion capacity, etc.). However, patients with severe ARDS may be unconscious or too weak to effectively perform these tests and cannot be transported to testing equipment. Furthermore, administering these tests requires close contact of healthcare personnel with patients, which increases the risk for healthcare personnel contracting a viral infection.

"3D Printed, Stretchable Epifluidic Platform",This technology is a 3D printed device that can be mounted on the skin and collects small amounts of sweat to measure its contents. The 3D printing technology enables the device to be custom manufactured to conform to an individual’s body and to be mounted without applying adhesives to the skin.,"Epifluidics is a rapidly evolving area of microfluidics, where devices are applied to the surface of the skin, typically to collect tiny amounts of sweat for analysis. The sweat can then be analyzed within the device to look for particular markers. Research suggests this type of technology can be used to non-invasively detect many health-related metrics, including hydration levels, blood sugar levels, and blood alcohol levels.

As an emerging area of innovation, there are few commercial applications of epifludics available. Furthermore, current technologies are generally limited in that they can be bulky and rigid, and they require the use of adhesive to keep them attached to the body. As a result, current epifluidic technologies are generally not conducive to long-term use.

This technology solves these limitations by leveraging 3D printing to create a soft, flexible device custom-manufactured to conform to an individual’s body, which in turn eliminates the need for adhesives to keep it in place and enables it to be worn comfortably for longer periods of time.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Surface Codes Based Quantum Networking,This invention uses surface codes to implement an extendable quantum communication network.,"Quantum communication makes use of quantum physics to create highly secure networks that are immune to many techniques used to intercept the communication while in transit. But because quantum information degrades quickly, there are limitations on how far the information can travel. This limitation is addressed by placing intermediate nodes between the source and destination, which act as “repeaters” to break the transmission into several steps of shorter distance. However, existing quantum repeater technology is inefficient and introduces latency into the transmission.

Furthermore, the security of a quantum communication network relies on the assumption that the nodes used to receive and transmit information are themselves secure. If a node were to be compromised, it could undermine the security network. Accordingly, as more repeater nodes are added, the network as a whole becomes less secure.

This invention uses surface codes, a technique used for error correction in quantum technologies, to implement a quantum communication network that leaves the nodes less susceptible to compromise and eliminates the latency typically introduced at repeater nodes.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common neoplasm in countries with high rates in caucasian populations and in cases of high UV ray exposure. In the United States alone, there are more than half a million new cases per year. Despite the fatality rate of non-melanoma skin cancer being minimal, it is known to cause significant impact including severe local destruction, permanent disfigurement and disability.

Currently, there are several recommended preventive measures for skin cancer including recommendations for avoiding UV rays from the sun or tanning beds, utilizing broad spectrum sunscreen and scheduling routine dermatologist examinations. Even with these preventive measures available to most, skin cancers cases are still bountiful.

Freeform Surface Metrology with Deflectometry,"Deflectometry is one of the potential techniques for freeform surface metrology. The display panel is either LCD, LED, or OLD and it displays a certain pattern onto the freeform surface. The cameras then record how the pattern is distorted on the surface and this is fed into a processing unit where it calculates the surface shape. This invention involves a robust and easy to use deflectometry system for measuring freeform surfaces. The system includes three cameras, two which are positioned at the edge of the display panel and one in the middle. The processing that this invention uses consists of a trained neural network to more accurately calculate the surface shape.","The two main issues with freeform surface metrology are that systems of this nature are not robust enough and they are often very difficult to use. It’s difficult to use because the location of parts must be precise and information about the surface must be known to be able to make a precise calculation.
The system will be robust as the cameras and display panel are integrated into one unit. This also helps with ease of use because the cameras and display panel will be in the same location relative to each other. This gets rid of the problem with having to know the precise location of components. Lastly, this solution utilizes a deep learning model to obtain the surface shape based on the patterns captured by the cameras. The multiple camera approach allows for a more accurate surface capture.",Imaging & Optics
Mobile Intraoral Camera Powered with Artificial Intelligence,"This invention is a mobile intraoral camera which consists of a flexible intraoral probe to reach the base of the tongue and tonsillar region of the oropharynx, a mobile process unit to capture, store, process, and transfer images, and automated image processing to identify suspicious areas within the mouth.","Intraoral cameras are an alternative that dentists may use instead of mirrors to review and examine the mouth of patients. The added benefit of using an intraoral camera compared to a mirror is that it provides the dentist high-resolution images of a patient's mouth that are real-time and the data can be stored for future reference. These images can be stored for time analysis of patients for better health care by providing timed data.

There are three main restrictions with current methods:
<ul>
<li>Some devices do not have a flexible head; therefore, to navigate around the tongue or bend the camera, one would have to move the full device.</li>
<li>Images collected do not have analysis on them. It requires a trained dentist to manually review the image and provide details on analysis.</li>
<li>Devices are expensive, usually priced at more than $1,000.</li>
</ul>
This invention addresses the first two restrictions of the current market. It provides a flexible head that is able to bend 90 degrees forwards and backwards for enhanced image collection. It also provides a scan of oral tissues to identify suspicious regions, deep learning-based lessons for guidance on the need for biopsy, with biopsy location, and data collection for remote diagnosis.

This area is patent-dense, with numerous inventors describing oral screening systems involving sensor screening devices and image processing.

Visible-Light Mediated Organophotoredox Catalytic Deuteration of Aromatic and Aliphatic Aldehydes,"This technology is an organophotoredox strategy that enables directly converting readily accessible aldehydes to their 1-deutero conterparts. The approach is distinct from the reported transition metal catalyzed ionic hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDE) processes. The power of this new process has not only been demonstrated for aromatic aldehydes, but also for aliphatic substrates, which have been difficult for HDE, and for selective late-stage deuterium incorporation into complex structures with uniformly high deuteration level (&gt;90%).","Among isotopes, deuterium perhaps has the broadest impact on almost every sub-discipline in the life, and chemical, material and nuclear sciences and beyond. The recent surge in applications of deuterated pharmaceutical agents has been witnessed by the FDA approval of the first deuterated drug, austedo (deutetrabenazine), in 2017 and the large number of emerging deuterated drug candidates. This has created an urgent demand for synthetic methods that enable the efficient generation of deuterated building blocks.",Research Tools

FPGA-Based Rate-Adaptive Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes for Optical Communications,This invention discloses a rate-adaptive forward error correction (FEC) scheme based on spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes derived from quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with its field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture. FPGA emulation demonstrates that the proposed LDPC codes provide larger coding gain and smaller error floor compared to the QC-LDPC base code with comparable computational complexity. The hardware friendly structure of the codes make them a promising candidate for the next-generation intelligent optical communication systems such as long-haul optical transmission system.,"Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes were discussed as early as 1962, in information theory research. The codes have encountered various performance barriers to speed and accuracy when decoding high volume of information, such as Shannon limit performance when information is decoded using a probabilistic algorithm, but continuing developments in new code construction, such as binary spatially-coupled codes based on Euclidean geometry have reduced errors compared with regular LDPC codes. As the speed requirement of modern optical communication systems keeps increasing, forward error correction (FEC) becomes an essential technique to enable high-speed transmission ranging from long-haul to access networks. LDPC codes have long strived for FEC from LDPC block code to the most recent spatially coupled (SC) LDPC code. SC-LDPC code approached asymptotic capacity as LDPC convolutional code (LDPC-CC) in 1999, and much research followed. Further analysis has shown that the decoding thresholds for the LDPC-CC codes are not only better than the belief propagation decoding thresholds of corresponding regular LDPC block codes, but also even very close to the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding thresholds.
 
This invention includes a simple method to construct a set of SC-LDPC codes with different code rates that is easily ported to hardware via an FPGA-ready configuration.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Gall Bladder Cryoablation Device,This device is a novel cryoablation procedure and probe to treat gallstones. The probe is designed to fit in the gall bladder. The probe will freeze and ablate the gallbladder and cystic ducts but won’t freeze other organs that are in close proximity with the gall bladder. This invention is a less invasive alternative to a cholecystectomy for healthy patients and for patients who are too ill for surgery.,"Patients who are treated for gallstones often have to undergo a cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder. Approximately 700,000 cholecystectomies performed annually. Cholecystectomies are performed as either as an open surgery or as a laparoscopic procedure. Surgery is costly and has risks. About 8% of patients have complications. A cholecystectomy can cost between $21,000 and $33,000. Some patients who require cholecystectomies are unable to have the surgery because they are too ill for the procedure. A less invasive and more cost-effective procedure is needed to address these issues.

An Implantable Miniaturized and Soft Wireless Sensor to Monitor Tissue and Bone Deformation,"This invention consists of an inexpensive implant to adhere to the bone. This device is capable of sensing bone strain, reporting loads passing through bone for extended periods of time. The implant can be used to monitor bone growth for bone segment repair for long bones or to monitor changes in bone characteristics of patients with osteoporosis. This technology has the potential to give physicians the ability to predict when a patient with osteoporosis has an impending fracture, and thus the ability to intervene and prevent further damage.","Osteoporosis, also known as a silence disease goes undetected and undiagnosed in more than 50% of cases. Due to its asymptomatic nature, osteoporosis is rarely detected in its earlier stage (Osteopenia) unless patients subject themselves to preventive screening, only until a fracture occurs will osteoporosis be diagnosed and begin to be treated. Though different tests such as Bone Mineral Density Testing provides an effective diagnostic of osteoporosis, monitoring of bone progress, deformation, or healing thereof, is largely unattended. The biggest task or need in the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis is in improving screening methods and monitoring bone deformation as the disease progresses.",Healthcare Portfolios

"Secure, Global Quantum Communications Networks",This invention proposes a quantum network of satellites in order to provide global coverage. The idea is to have terrestrial quantum networks be connected with low earth orbit satellites and have a subnetwork of medium and greater earth orbit satellites. This invention capitalizes on the security and speed of quantum networks and common satellite communications.,"Quantum communication takes advantage of the laws of quantum physics to protect data. These laws allow particles—typically photons of light for transmitting data along optical cables—to take on a state of superposition, which means they can represent multiple combinations of 1 and 0 simultaneously. The particles are known as quantum bits, or qubits. If viewed, qubits break down to either a 1 or 0 because of their fragile quantum state. This makes quantum communication secure because information cannot be viewed or tampered with when it is being sent.

Quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in qubits between physically separated quantum processors. A quantum processor is a small quantum computer able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits. Quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks. The main difference is that quantum networking is better at solving certain problems.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Using Sound to Extract and Analyze Medical Information from Patient Encounters,"This invention is a system that can be used to record non-verbal vocalization and mathematically analyze the breathing sounds of patients. The breathing sounds are crucial to diagnose patients who have a chronic or acute respiratory illness. Analysis will include: HNR, NHR, EE, STE, ZCR, SR, SC, SF, jitter and shimmer. In addition, the system can integrate sound elements with neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) technology.","In recent years, the prevalence of respiratory diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema have increased. Millions of people in the US and globally are diagnosed with respiratory diseases every year. It is believed that more than 30% of the information about the patient comes from nonverbal cues. In routine doctor-patient interactions, much of the nonverbal acoustic information is not captured and is lost. This information is valuable for all cases and breathing sounds are a main source of information in diagnosing a patient with a respiratory illness, irregularity, or disease. Current methods involve spirometry which is a way to measure airway obstruction by measuring inflows and outflows. There is a lack of utilizing spirometry as a diagnostic tool because of a knowledge gap for physicians and the availability of spirometers. Many patients with respiratory illness are wrongly diagnosed due to the similarity in symptoms for common diseases and illnesses. This technology has the potential to improve current diagnosis methods and enhance the accuracy of respiratory diagnosis, improving patient care.",Healthcare Portfolios
Pseudo-Nulling Mach-Zehnder Metrology,"This technology is a novel Mach-Zehnder interferometer that uses a a pseudo-nulling configuration with a converging beam, to test two optical components against each other, rather that testing one optical component against a reference component","As the capability of optical manufacturing has grown such that it is easy to mass produce optical components with non-symmetric surfaces, optical metrology – the process of measuring these surfaces – has also been forced to push in new directions to characterize complex optical surfaces. Various techniques have been used to measure large and small optical elements, from measuring local surface slopes in deflectometry to wavefront differences in interferometry and height differences in profilometry. However, measurement of steep slopes on optical surfaces remains a challenge for all methods and one that hinders fast, accurate measurement.
 
Interferometers are commonly used to characterize optical surfaces. Interferometers compare wavefront properties from a surface being tested with wavefront properties from a reference source through an output called an interferogram. This image contains contrast fringes representing the combination of wavefronts that reveals differences between the test surface and reference beam. One way of measuring complex optical surfaces is to introduce a “null lens” into the interferometer that acts to correct for deviations in the test surface such that the final interogram is a null image with no fringes. However, creating a physical null lens or a virtual null lens through computer generated holograms is a time-consuming process and one that must be repeated for each new surface under test. Therefore, it is desirable to find other approaches that act like a null lens without actually requiring a null lens.",Imaging & Optics
Novel Phosphorylation that Controls the Stability of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha,"This invention relates to a polyclonal antibody against a novel phosphorylation site that is known to be correlated with increased tumor growth. Specifically, the antibody targets a phosphorylation site on HIF-1α which is controlled by PIM kinases. This invention can be used not only as a therapeutic against cancer but also potentially as a means for predicting responses to PIM kinase inhibitors during drug development as way to test the sensitivity to other PIM kinase inhibitors and anti-angiogenic drugs.","Anti-angiogenic therapy is a new and promising strategy for combatting solid cancers including myeloma, leukemia, prostate and breast cancer. Angiogenesis is considered a hallmark indicator of tumorigenesis and is believed to be required for tumor growth and metastasis. HIF-1 is a master regulator gene involved in the cellular response to hypoxia. Activation of HIF-1 is dependent on HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels rise due to phosphorylation by PIM kinases which become overexpressed under hypoxic conditions. This leads to further activation of HIF-1 and results in transcription of genes involved in tumorigenesis including angiogenesis.
 
In attempting to develop effective treatments against solid cancers, it has been shown that prolonged activation of HIF-1 is associated with greater resistance to anti-angiogenic agents. Thus, this invention is a promising approach because it is an antibody that targets the phosphorylation site on HIF-1α to prevent phosphorylation by PIM kinase, thus reducing HIF-1 master regulator activation, and ultimately, decreasing resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs.",Healthcare Portfolios

Organic Semiconductors via Pyrene Oxidation with High Yield and No Metal Catalyst,"This invention is an efficient, green route for oxidizing simple pyrenes without any metal-mediated catalyst or reagent, with desired product in high yield.  This direct oxidation method may be used to synthesize organic semi-conductors for use as photovoltaics, transistors, LEDs while avoiding poor yields, product impurities, and expensive work-up.  This method has been demonstrated for selectively oxidizing the K-region of pyrenes using a meta-free oxidizing agent to produce a pyrene 4,5-dione and/or a pyrene 4,5,9,10-tetraone compounds.","Pyrene compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules that are used widely in various applications including, but not limited to, use as fluorescent probes and starting materials for producing various organic electronic components such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Chemical modifications of pyrenes through a variety of methods enable their incorporation into more complex chemical systems make them useful starting materials for larger organic semiconductors as they enable the extension of the π- conjugated system via simple condensation reactions with ortho-diamines. This strategy enables the synthesis of imine rich N-heteroacene chains known as pyrene-fused pyrazaacenes (PPAs) that exhibit a wide range tunable semiconducting properties (p-type to n-type) unlike their nitrogen-free acene counterparts. Owing to the two Clar sextets provided per pyrene subunit, PPAs are air-stable even above 500C. Even though ortho-quinones of pyrenes are useful starting materials for the synthesis of PPAs and other organic semi-conductors, their synthesis via direct oxidation of pyrene derivatives have been difficult due to lack of selectivity to desired products, even with expensive transition metal catalysts, as well as the expense and loss of product during purification due to formation of tarry residue. Moreover, use of these transition metals results in wastes that are environmentally toxic and requires additional cost and time for disposal.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"

Synthesis and Characterization of Innovative Formulations of Suramin Hydrogels for Drug Delivery and Applications Therein,"This invention consists of new advanced formulations of the drug Suramin for administration by multiple routes. In addition, the invention surrounds the process and manufacturing of these newly formulated Suramin microparticles and nanoparticles so they can be effectively used in the treatment of wounds. Specifically, these new formulations would be utilized for wound healing purposes in mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers.","Oral mucositis is a consequence of chemotherapy and radiation treatment of head and neck cancer, the third most common cancers with nearly 550,000 cases per year. However, chemotherapy and radiation have horrible side effects, with the most common being ulcers and sores of the mouth and throat, otherwise known as mucositis. Nearly 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 100% of patients receiving radiation experience mucositis, which results in pain, trouble breathing and swallowing, and infections. In addition, diabetic foot ulcers occur in nearly 15% of all diabetic patients and precede nearly 85% of all diabetic related amputations. 
These serious complications of highly prevalent diseases have limited treatment options. If left untreated, mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers have horrible effects on patients ranging from pain and infections to the loss of a limb. This invention re-formulates Suramin to help promote wound healing. Currently, Suramin can only be administered intravenously, which means a medical professional must administer each dose and each dose is delivered invasively. This technology could potentially allow Suramin to be administered by more patient-friendly routes including non-invasive targeted routes. Early studies have already shown its effectiveness in increasing the healing process of diabetic related sores in a mouse model.",Healthcare Portfolios

eADR Software: Electronic Automation of the Calculation of Adenoma Detection Rate,"This technology is a set of algorithms that are able to automate the calculation of the Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR), a widely accepted global performance benchmark on quality for screening colonoscopy. The ADR is a reportable rate of a doctor’s ability to find adenomas, attempt of endoscopic removal of polyps, and more.","Colon cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths globally and the second highest in the United States.

Control (Delay or Accelerate) Hypersonic Boundary-Layer Transition,"This invention is novel flow control techniques for modifying the natural to turbulent transition process of the flow in the boundary layer of vehicles, projectiles, or missiles at supersonic/hypersonic speeds. This invention is concerned with delaying the onset of transition and the subsequent breakdown to turbulence as far downstream on the vehicle as possible. As the transition process in high-speed boundary layers is associated with strong unsteadiness, large pressure fluctuations, and intermittency, it may also be beneficial to accelerate transition to quickly establish a fully turbulent state. The key component proposed in the invention is ""Imbedded Compact Control Actuators” (ICCAs) which will delay or prevent entirely the negative effects caused by the boundary-layer transition, including the detrimental effects of the unsteadiness in flow. This proposed technology will alleviate skin friction and wall-heating to increase payload and range of the specified vehicle while also reducing cost and weight of the vehicle.","The fluidic state of the boundary layer, laminar, transitional, or turbulent, determines the degree of skin friction and heating of high-speed vehicles. The drag caused by skin friction contributes a large portion to the total drag of a high-speed vehicle. Higher drag reduces the range and/or maximum payload of the vehicle. High wall-heating requires special materials that are very expensive and/or require Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) that add to the weight of the vehicle so that the maximum payload and/or the range of the vehicle is reduced.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Real-Time Monitoring of the Diffraction Efficiency of Volume Holographic Elements During Exposure,"This invention is concerned with improving manufacturing accuracy and speed of Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) through more accurate diffraction efficiency measurement in real-time measurement conditions. Diffraction efficiency is an important characteristic of VHOEs, and the most basic technique for controlling the diffraction efficiency during fabrication is to use separate beams to expose the holographic material and measure the material’s efficiency. However, this technique is time consuming and requires additional equipment. Ideally, a measurement technique that used the exposure beam would reduce both these limitations.","Most Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) must attain certain diffraction efficiency depending on the design. In many designs the diffraction efficiency should be maximized, while in other designs, such as exit pupil expanders in waveguide display systems, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. In other setups, light from a separate laser at a different wavelength from the construction wavelength and at a separate incident angle is used to measure the diffraction efficiency. The diffraction efficiency at the construction wavelength can then be obtained through mathematical approximations. However, this method requires additional equipment and complicated experimental setups and the mathematical approximations reduce the accuracy of the method.
In this invention, a new technique for monitoring the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs in real-time is proposed that has potential for higher accuracy and greater simplicity than previous setups. The invention has potential for fabricating VHOEs that have precise tolerance in the required diffraction efficiency.",Imaging & Optics
Snapshot Phase-Shifting Diffraction Phase Microscope,"This invention proposes combining snapshot phase-shifting interferometry with high resolution polarization imaging to create quantitative phase maps from diffraction microscopy. A polarization grating separates the incident beam into object and reference beams, and a digital camera captures four phase-shifted interferograms from polarization filters to reconstruct a high spatial resolution phase map. Due to the common path configuration and snapshot feature, the proposed system provides a feasible way for real time quantitative phase measurement with minimal environmental impact.","Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) refers to methods of collecting high resolution images and using both phase and amplitude data to create quantitative phase maps. These are particularly valuable for microscopic examination of tissue samples because data can be collected with minimal harm to the tissue and in some cases may be collected in vivo. Traditional QPI methods require widely separated optical paths, which can introduce noise through vibrations in the setup or even air turbulence. Diffraction phase microscopy and other off-axis imaging systems reduce this noise through using a common optical path for the object and reference beam, but this configuration often limits the size of the imaging field that can be collected. Also, creating the phase maps can be computationally intensive, preventing real-time imaging. Algorithm refinement can reduce the processing time for holographic imaging (another off-axis image collection method), as can optimization of graphics processing.

This invention overcomes these limitations by using a diffraction phase microscope with polarization grating, phase-shifting interferometry, and a polarization camera to create a larger field real-time phase map. Similar approaches use holography with spatial light modulators, diffraction phase microscopy with optimized graphics card processing, polarization wavefront shaping, and digital holography with polarization states.",Imaging & Optics

Quantum information theory has proved that the lowest physically reachable error rate of decoding is far below receiver’s error rate. This has created the need for an improved receiver. There has been research and development aimed to design a much-improved receiver. The introduction of deep learning as a computational model can address this complex task.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Germanium Extraction from Electronic Wastes Using an Environment-Friendly Hydrometallurgical Process,"Hydrometallurgy is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy, the obtaining of metals from their ores. Hydrometallurgy involves the use of aqueous solutions for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. The focus of this study is on an environmental hydrometeorological recycling process of Germanium (Ge) from electronic wastes. For this purpose, the dissolution factor is considered, and a type of weak acid (acetic acid) is used to extract Ge from the electronic wastes, which has the lowest impact on the humans and the environment.","Results show that there are significant opportunities to meet the future demand of Germanium (Ge) by concentrating recovery efforts in the extraction and beneficiation/smelting/refining stages. Up to now, the existing studies about the recovery of Ge mainly focused on the hydrometallurgical processes to extract Ge, followed by a process to separate Ge from other elements contained in leachates. The negative point of those methods is the high consumption of strong reagents. Hydrometallurgy uses strong inorganic/organic acids or caustic watery solutions to selectively dissolve and precipitate metals. The goal of this method is to use a technique that avoids the strong reagents that are not only harmful to the environment but also very toxic to humans. Some electronic waste recovery methods come with severe environmental implications such as open burning, acid leaching, uncontrolled dumping of hazardous elements and hazardous wastes, etc.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Joint QKD-Post-Quantum Cryptosystems,This technology is a joint quantum key distribution (QKD)-post-quantum cryptosystem. The QKD is used for raw-key transmission and post-quantum crypto-system to transmit parity bits for information reconciliation. The technology can be further advanced by encoding either Slepian states-based encoding or OAM encoding. This would help overcome the low-spectral efficiency of time-phase-encoding but the complexity of the QKD hybrid system would increase. The proposed system is able to achieve a record transmission distance of 1127 km.,"The need for secure communications has become essential because of the rising threat and impact of data breaches. The adoption of quantum key distribution over traditional public/private key security has improved the security of communications. However, there are still a handful of constraints of QKD. Some of these include cost, distance limitations and still under development. By implementing a system similar to this invention, the limitation of distance can be reduced and further increase the feasibility of QKD systems.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Quantum Computing Architecture based on Large Scale Multidimensional Continuous-Variable Cluster States in a Scalable Photonic Platform,This technology is a one-way quantum computing architecture that is based on programmable large-scale continuous variables states. The technology is based on two distinct fields: Kerr microcombs and continuous-variable quantum information. This architecture is able to accommodate hundreds of simultaneously addressable entangled optical modes multiplexed in the frequency domain and an infinite number of sequentially addressable entangled optical modes in time domain.,"Quantum computing has been thought of as a disruptive technology believed to be capable of addressing classically unsolvable problems. However, there are several current issues with the technology limiting its potential. These include scalability of the platform, the connectivity of qubits, and the required fidelity of various components. One-way quantum computing is a promising approach that can address these obstacles.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
A Hybrid Geopolymer-Biopolymer Cementitious Material for Enhancing Pumpable Roof Support in Underground Mining,"This invention is a new hybrid cementitious material that has a high viscosity rate to be used in pumpable roof support application in underground mining. This hybrid is a fusion of geopolymer and biopolymer that results in a high load stiffness, high peak strength, and large residual strength compared to current cementitious material used in this application. This increases the safety of underground mining.","Underground mining is essential for acquiring materials in everyday use. Underground mining consists of digging tunnels and/or shafts into the earth. As these structures are built in the early and equipment is moved into the earth to extract the material, strong support structures are required within the tunnels and shafts to prevent ground falls. Ground falls lead to 8 to 10 fatalities and approximately 800 injuries globally each year. Therefore, design and construction of roof supports, to prevent ground falls, are critical to ensure safety. The intrinsic supports systems, such as roof bolts, and standing support systems, such as cribs and posts, are the two most common roof support systems. These support systems provide the three key factors for roof supports. These key factors include maximum load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and residual strength. Secondary factors include timing of installation, stability of support as it is loaded, and capability of support system to provide skin control. New technology has provided a third option of pumpable roof supports, due to its ease and speed of instability. However, there are issues with finding a satisfactory pumpable cementitious grout material that has high load stiffness, high peak strength, and large residual strength when compared to the two preferred methods.",Materials
Bed-Sled 2,"This invention is a resistance-training device with the purpose of strengthening the lower extremities, preventing muscle de-conditioning and overall weakness, and a formation of blood clots.",Surgical patients and members of the elderly population are at an increased risk for developing a blood clot in their lower extremities due to a lack of physical activity. This potentially fatal condition can be prevented with increased attention to the conditioning of leg muscles. The lackluster presence of devices tailored to this condition in the rehabilitation technology market could allow this training device to fulfill the demand for a non-invasive and minimally strenuous method of preventing fatal blood clots with a means of tracking strength progression.,Medical Devices
Improvements to Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Guide for Hip Fracture Fixation,"This invention is a design for a minimally invasive dynamic hip screw guide that will fix the position and angle in the frontal plane for the intramedullary rod. This device is a guide that can be placed on the leg rather than directly on the bone, allowing for a procedure that is significantly less invasive. This current adaptation of the invention includes aspects considered to be improvements to the already patented design.","Intertrochanteric hip fractures are most commonly treated with a sliding hip screw implant. These fractures are most common to the elderly, where surgery time and blood loss are of the utmost importance when performing surgery. These fractures have high mortality rates (15-20%) because of the high chance of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and pulmonary embolism. Intertrochanteric fractures are one of the three types of hip fractures and occur between the lesser trochanter and the neck of the femur. Stable fractures are currently treated with engineered fixation devices, usually plate/ screw implants with an intramedullary rod.",Healthcare Portfolios
Breast Tumor Targeted Fluorescence Guidance for Intraoperative Margin Assessment,This technology is an anti-CEACAM6 antibody tagged with fluorescent labels. The idea is that these fluorescent antibodies can be used for real-time molecular fluorescence imaging to help guide the surgical removal of a tumor. This technology is targeted toward breast cancer.,"Over half of the 270,000 breast cancer diagnoses in the United States are for early stage disease; this is the population of women who will ultimately benefit from this research. A majority of these women will be candidates for breast conserving surgery, which consists of removal of the primary breast cancer with a surrounding margin of normal tissue. 

Breast conservation is associated with decreased operative risk, shorter recovery time, and decreased disruption of body image and quality of life. Furthermore, there is no difference in breast cancer mortality between lumpectomy and total mastectomy. Because of these significant advantages, breast conserving surgery continues to be the preferred operative approach for unifocal breast cancer.",Life Sciences
The Use of Active Flow Control on Combined Tilt Rotor & Tilt Wing Airplanes,"This technology is a method to eliminate moving control surfaces on the wing, prop, tail and other surfaces of a tilt wing airplane. It accomplishes this by utilizing active flow control measures. The end result is a combination of tilted wing with active flow controls designed to reduce the power demand of the tilt rotor wing aircraft. Reduced power demand enables aircraft to expand their payload capability.","Currently, aircraft have bulky and heavy wings and tail rudders that affect the aerodynamics. The adoption of active flow control systems can improve various aspects of the airplane. It will now be able to have smaller wings and tail rudder which leads to several other advantages. Active flow control can be achieved through various methods.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
"CycleSafe - Proximity Sensing, Warning, and Reporting Device",This technology is a bicycle handlebar-mounted device. The device has a sensor that can detect when a car is too close to warn bicyclists of encroaching vehicles and provides a visual alert to the car’s driver to promote a safe passing distance from the bicyclist. The device can also take and store a picture of the vehicle and license plate for reporting to authorities if needed.,"States generally have laws that mandate that an automobile must give a bicycle a minimum amount of space while passing on a road. The reality is that this rule is seldom followed. For an example, in 2013 there were nearly 50,000 bicyclists who suffered injuries as a result of automobile drivers. The introduction of bike lanes has been shown to reduce the frequency of injury and death by up to 90%, however not all roads contain bike lanes. Bicyclists continue to endure the risk of injury and death due to negligence of drivers who do not maintain a safe passing distance, regardless of whether they ride in a bike lane or not. This technology will create greater accountability of drivers and further decrease the rate of automobile-related bicyclist injury and death.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
A Novel Chemicals' Scheme for the Flotation of Bastnaesite Ore,"This invention is a flotation method for removing heavy earth metals from Bastnaesite ore. It works by reducing the flotation temperature to a cost-efficient level and simplifying the flow sheet. Results show that 80-90% REE recovery and &lt;20% gangue recovery are achieved at 40°C-60°C, which yield a rougher concentrate of 30%~40% REO. The new scheme is of both high selectivity and high recovery, meanwhile the dosage of reagent required is much less, and the flotation temperature is also significantly reduced.","Bastnaesite is the most important ore mineral at the Mountain Pass mine in San Bernardino, California near the Nevada border. It is an important ore of the rare earths, especially the lighter end members, including europium. Bastnaesite is also an important ore mineral at a number of other rare earth mines in China, including several deposits in Sichuan Province, and the massive deposit at Bayan Obo, Inner Mongolia. Although Mountain Pass closed in the early 2000s, a Chinese minority shareholder, acquired Mountain Pass in July 2017 with the goal of reviving America's rare earth industry. The company resumed mining and refining operations in January 2018. It is the only rare earth mining and processing facility in the United States, thus making it critical for securing the supply chain of rare earth metals domestically in the United States.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Quantum Random Number Generator,This invention is a quantum random number generator (QRNGs) that provides a method to generates numbers that are mathematically guaranteed to be random at the highest rate allowed by current methods. This new method leverages quantum computing systems standard practices and enhances the confidence of randomness to the numbers that are generated for industry use.,"This invention applies a higher level of certainty of randomness to random number selection as it pertains to usage in the national defense and cyber security. Cybersecurity and digital privacy systems require random numbers to encrypt and authenticate data. Randomness is essential in everything we do with computational and communications. Currently, the hardware that is used to provide these random numbers are based from a physical process, not by the means of an algorithm. Currently methods leverage hardware random number generations as they have been proven to provide a higher level of random numbers for industry practice.",Software & Information Technology
ASLM Headset Display by Stacked Waveguides,This invention involves beam steering to increase the field of view (FOV) of augmented reality headsets or smart-glasses while maintaining true RGB color with minimal distortion. The invention uses angle-dependent image projection with micro-mirrors operating at 30 hz to create a 90 degree x 30 degree FOV with 1 arcmin/pixel resolution at 24-bit RGB color.,"Current virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets have a limited field of view that restricts them from reaching their full capabilities. These headsets are currently being used widely for entertainment, creative purposes, designing, medicine, therapy, business management and training. This research will allow for integration of current product goals in to packaging the size of a typical pair of glasses.
 
Earlier technology, like in Google Glass, used polarized beam combiners to combine a digital display with a see-through real world scene. However, the field of view was small: 13-20 degrees. Meta 2 used off-axis semi-spherical combiner and achieved almost 90 degree FOV but the headsets were bulky. Waveguides use diffraction gratings to bend light through total internal reflection and direct the digital graphics to the eye. Magic Leap headsets have a 120 degree x 90 degree FOV. However, waveguides require precision construction and they are sensitive to environmental conditions like temperature. Plus, the angular resolution suffers with larger displays in the typical trade-off between image crispness and FOV.",Imaging & Optics
Adjustable Full Stokes Polarization Eyewear,"This technology is a method for tunable polarization lenses for eyewear. Individuals have the ability to tune the polarization of their lenses based on environmental inputs and their preferences. With this full range of tunability, users are able to maximize their view without having to use just one polarization type for all environments.","Currently, there is a wide range of lenses that are offered to individuals when they are looking to purchase eyewear products. Each of these different types of lenses offers a slightly different view and may offer additional eye benefits to the individual. This can include lenses that are polarized to block different types of light, UV-protection, or trivex which is considered to help correct vision more efficiently.
 
Individuals who are looking for polarized lenses have the ability to select different types and levels of polarization. A majority of the polarized lenses offer linear polarization which gives individuals improved contrast and a reduced amount of glare. However, this one type of polarization does not meet every situation for individuals because light can reflect in multiple polarization states and a single polarization type is unable to filter all glare or reflection. With this technology an individual has the ability to tailor the polarization to their need. This allows individuals to be faced with multiple types of light reflection and have the ability to filter it. Specialized sunglasses and goggles for outdoor activities also market color optimization (light spectrum properties) outside of light intensity and reflectance control.",Imaging & Optics
Reconfigurable Polarization Imaging System,This technology is a reconfigurable snapshot polarimetric imaging method for the color camera. The method measures polarization properties with spectral-polarization filters. This method has the ability to collect circular or elliptical polarization information.,"Polarization imaging is described as the ability to describe light through reflecting objects. Currently, there are a few common methods that are being used. First, is the division of time which grants users with a high spatial resolution but the temporal resolution is not as strong. Then there is the division of amplitude and the division of aperture which are commonly used to collect images. Lastly, there is the development of the snapshot polarization imaging technique where users are unable to measure circular or elliptical information.
 
This technology offers consumers the ability to collect different types of information while maintaining a high spatial resolution and enhanced reconfigurability.",Imaging & Optics
Waveguide for Angular Space Light Modulator Display,"This invention is a specialized waveguide design that is tuned to the unique Angular Space Light Modulator (ASLM) angle dependent pattern output. This achieves an extended field of view (FOV) output, which is small enough to be integrated into a headset with packaging as small as a typical pair of glasses. This compactness and wide field of view is the ultimate goal for the Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) headset industry.","Current VR and AR headsets have a limited field of view that restricts them reaching their full capabilities. The use of typical Spatial Light Modulators (SLM) have several restrictive design requirements that cause these limitations.

Complex Diversity for Inverse Problems,"This invention is a new technique called complex diversity which improves performance of single shot phase retrieval algorithms used in many areas including adaptive optics, microscope imaging, and virtual reality.","Phase retrieval is a technique to measure unknown extrinsic phase disturbances, which is attractive because of its simplicity compared to more complicated systems that involve interferometers or Shack-Hartmann sensors. Phase retrieval drawbacks include the requirement of multiple image acquisitions (“shots”), low accuracy, and stagnation issues. Some of these issues have been overcome by single-shot phase retrieval associated with various diversities.
 
For single-shot techniques, the effective filter applied to the diffracted orders and an accurate reconstruction algorithm that utilizes the effective filters have not been adequately discussed. This research discusses accurate effective filters that are determined in a new diversity concept called complex diversity for single-shot phase retrieval, and an associated reconstruction algorithm is proposed.

Smartphone-Based Epifluorescence Microscope,"This invention describes a smartphone-based microscope developed for the purposes of increasing the quality of current smartphone-based microscopes without adding additional costs. By utilizing exact measurements and calculations, the claim of the invention is that it can better preserve image quality and improve the field of view when used in conjunction with a smartphone. The quality of the smartphone-based microscope is like a common bench microscope often used in medicine and industry.","Microscopes for clinical applications cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to several thousand. Thinking of the traditional bench microscope, they lack portability and easy access to areas that otherwise would benefit from them. Microscopes serve as an important tool for educational purposes and cell feature identification in specimens especially for clinical uses (such as cancer identification in skin).
 
Ideally, using a smartphone camera as a microscope solves the issues of portability and accessibility as most people have smartphones. However, as a result, issues involving image fidelity and quality arise as one attempts to mount a mechanical system (the microscope) to a digital device (the smartphone). The proposed invention describes an end-user device that ameliorates these issues through specific lens calculations and considerations involving the smartphone/microscope junction.",Imaging & Optics
System and Method for Rapid Prototyping of 3D Heterogeneous Nanostructures,This invention is a system and method used for optically positioning and linking colloidal nanoparticles using an optical tweezer. This invention allows for precise positioning and chemical coatings for linking. It is similar to a 3D printer in that it is capable of nanoscale 3D printing of objects and structures that are made of several different materials but has a much finer resolution than existing 3D printing techniques. The invention combines several tools and methods in a novel way to achieve its capability. The capability of the system to 3D print heterogeneous nanostructures is beyond any nanoscale 3D printers currently on the market.,"Nanotechnology is a field of science and technology that manufactures, uses, or measures structures that have some dimensions that are less than 100 nanometers in length. Nanotechnology has recently seen an enormous amount of interest and advancement (some have even called it “the Industrial Revolution of the twenty-first century”) due to its broad range of applications across many other disciplines and fields. Some of these possibilities include medicine, energy, robotics, manufacturing, and optics. However, prototyping for research and development requires a lot of resources and it can be very expensive and time consuming with many steps involved. 3D printing has become popular in larger scale manufacturing prototyping due to its relatively high turnaround rates and lower costs of machinery. For these reasons, 3D printing on the nanoscale has also become a topic of interest in developing nanotechnology. The limitations to the current state of art nanoscale 3D printers are resolution sizes and being able to print with only one medium (usually a very specific type of material, such as photo-resins).
 
The invention addresses these concerns of current nano-3D printing methods by using a system in which multiple materials (ranging from plastics to metals to biological materials) can all be used in a single print, with very high resolution. The implications of this invention would be that researchers and scientists, or even smaller size businesses would be able to prototype nanotechnology at much lower costs and higher speed than current methods of creating heterogeneous nanostructures.",Imaging & Optics
Aperture Designs To Minimize Diffraction Noise,"This invention is a new aperture design to eliminate deleterious diffraction effects when trying to observe a dim object next to a very bright object, such as a planet next to a star. The novel aspect is in the design and shape of the edges of each pupil section that makes up the aperture. This design reduces the non-uniform distribution of background radiation and enables high fidelity digital image reconstruction with less noise.","Today, large aperture telescopes use segmented primary mirrors that are periodically discontinuous with straight lines. These discontinuities, which mimic a diffraction grating, result in a non-uniform distribution of background light across the image plane, create unwanted ghost images and scatter unwanted radiation to obscure faint objects. This serves as a noise source during digital image reconstruction, which leads to misinterpreted scenes.",Imaging & Optics
Solar Generator with Two-Stage Optical Concentration Onto PV Cells,University of Arizona researchers have developed a photovoltaic (PV) solar power generator that leverages optical design principles to obtain high power conversion performance and the robustness of operation at lower cost.,"As competition continues to grow within the solar power market, more efficient and less costly solar power systems are in high demand.

Tandem Photovoltaic Module with Diffractive Spectral Separation,Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a design for a solar concentrating device that has a solar tracker and a diffractive grating as a part of the entrance window or glass for the sunlight to enter through. The technology is designed for use in conjunction with a solar cell for solar panels. The grating delivers specific diffracted orders of light to matched semiconductor material with different band gaps (high and low). The novel grating design can deliver four times the amount of concentrated sunlight than competing designs.,Solar technology has proven to be a source for renewable energy but poses a problem of converting an efficient amount of sunlight (based on how much sunlight is received) into electronic power. Concentrating sunlight for greater efficiency has become a main focus in renewable energy from the sun as a source. Research has proven that dividing the solar spectrum to focus specific wavelengths to focus onto and be absorbed by different band gap material for the best solar to electronic conversion. Since the aforementioned discovery many diffractive and optical interferometric techniques have been employed to increase conversion efficiency.,Imaging & Optics
Achromatic and Polarization Adaptive Optics System,"This invention is an adaptive optics (AO) system for broadband and/or polarization dependent light. The system includes a wavefront sensor and compensator, and the compensator splits the broad waveband into different wavelength and/or polarization states, applies compensation, then recombines the light into a single wavefront with distortions that may be compensated by following optical elements of the AO system. The wavefront compensator is based on known optical corrections techniques but applied in a new way.","Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of incoming wavefront distortions by deforming a mirror or applying an optical filter like a spatial light modulator (SLM) in order to compensate for distortions.
In existing AO systems, the compensation is the same for light of all wavelength and polarization states. The system works well as long as the distortions for different wavelength and polarization state are the same. For light sources with a broad range of wavelength and different polarization states, the distortion compensation will be incomplete, leading to greater blur in the spatial resolution in the resulting image. This invention proposes a design of an AO system that can better compensate distortions in broadband and polarized light.",Imaging & Optics

Multiple-Wavelength Quantitative Phase Imaging Technique,"This invention is a new way to apply adaptive optics principles to image properties of biological cells. This method uses multi-spectral digital holographic imaging and random phase masks to extract phase maps comparable to maps from traditional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) optical systems though with less complication and expense. This method provides a fast, low-cost method for acquiring detailed multi-spectral data for cell objects.","Imaging biological cells and tissues is central to research and medical diagnosis, and imaging tissues requires contrast to distinguish areas of interest from the background. In the past, use of dye or other form of staining or tagging structures was necessary to achieve sufficient contrast but this contrast data was qualitative rather than quantitative. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) emerged as a method to create a phase map of the sample to indicate refractive / optical path differences through tissue structure. Digital holography captures both phase and amplitude data from interference of reference and object waves, but phase maps do not separate tissue physical thickness differences from refractive differences. Instead, use of multiwavelength digital holography can provide quantitative 3D color images and dispersion information.",Imaging & Optics
Method of Measuring Distorted Illumination Patterns and Correcting Image Artifacts in Structured Illumination Imaging,"This technology is an improvement to the well-established microscopy technique structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which uses a periodic structured pattern of light to image a sample. In SIM, it is common for artifacts to arise during imaging, because the pattern is often distorted due to aberration and index mismatches in samples. These artifacts distort the image and reduce the amount of information that can be extracted from the raw data. This technology is capable of correcting distortions in challenging experimental situations, such as strong background scattering, low signal-to-noise-ratio, and a sparse sample structure. In addition, it is easily applied to existing hardware, making it cost-effective and simple to implement into existing workflows, as opposed to current solutions which utilize much more expensive adaptive optics to accomplish the same effect.","Structured illumination microscopy has been around since the late 1990s but is still being improved as a technique. SIM can be used in multiple ways: optical sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) and super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), among others. OS-SIM allows the technique to act much like a confocal microscope, reducing out-of-focus light and thus increasing contrast. SR-SIM can be used to increase a microscope’s resolution below the diffraction limit of light, previously thought to be impossible. While it is currently better suited to techniques like OS-SIM, this technology has the potential to be applied to both types of SIM.

Other techniques for reduction of out-of-focus light exist, like Leica’s Computational Clearing technology, but they are more limited in their potential applications. This technology has the potential to cheaply and easily improve results from existing structured illumination microscopy hardware in a variety of different applications.",Imaging & Optics
"Fabrication, Design and Application of High Resolution Patterned Polarization Filter","This invention describes achromatic polarization filters that can be integrated with a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) and charge-coupled device (CCD) detector array to form a polarization camera. The proposed variants of pixelated polarization filters would have applications in display and sensor designs and could cover light sources, such as organic light emitting diodes or liquid crystal light panel, to form a polarization display which can display an image of arbitrary polarization states.","For many applications, there is a need to create an array of polarization filters with well-defined shape and orientation. For existing CMOS and CCD optical sensor arrays, the size of the pixel can be of the order of one micron or smaller. There is a need to create patterned polarization filters that have the same dimension and shape as the pixel. The current problem in practice, is a transition region between regions of one alignment angle and an adjacent region of an alternate alignment angle. This can range from 0.5 to 5 microns and limits the spatial resolution of the patterns in the polarization filter. The disclosed research provides a fabrication technique that can reduce and/or remove the limiting transition regions.",Imaging & Optics

Despite the clinical significance of this data, there is currently no simple and effective method suitable for routine in-clinic assessment of muscle function. This technology’s strength lies in its ability to produce reliable data while also being inexpensive to assemble for the clinic and easy to use for the patient. It has the potential to enable rapid, cost-effective, and reliable collection of muscle function data which can inform wide variety of diagnoses and provide a better picture of a patient’s health.","Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of skeletal mass and function, is associated with many chronic diseases, including advanced heart failure. Currently, it is often diagnosed by methods that are either simple-to-use but prone to variability between observers, such as anthropometry, or involve exposing the patient to ionizing radiation, like dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Techniques like mechanomyography have long been investigated for applications in muscle function assessment, but have found limited usefulness.
In addition, the time is right for wearable devices. Devices that assess muscle function in athletics and sports medicine are growing more and more popular, and it is only a matter of time before they make the jump to the clinic. This technology is an excellent opportunity to jump in on the growing popularity of wearable devices, while simultaneously improving assessment and screening of a wide variety of quickly growing disorders such as heart failure, associated with an aging population.",Healthcare Portfolios

The small rotation allows the ability to use smaller landing gear size and in result reduces the overall weight of the aircraft.,"A notable challenge in aviation and in particular naval aviation is reducing the length required for takeoff and landing runs. Currently, flaps and slats are being used before and during takeoff procedure to increase the drag ratio. The adoption of active flow control technologies will propel the abilities of airplanes takeoff process and could alter the designs of future airplanes to lighter structures.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
The Use of Active Flow Control to Eliminate Vertical Stabilizers and Moving Control Surfaces,This technology will use sweeping jet actuators to replace the moving control surface on an airplane tail vertical stabilizers.,"With the aviation industry looking for methods to reduce the amount of material it takes to create an aircraft, there is a need to find alternative designs with less material. Reduced material in producing aircrafts is also favorable because it can result in decreased fuel utilization. Currently vertical stabilizers and rudders are primarily used conjunction with other moveable control surfaces to maneuver aircrafts. The present invention will replace the moving control surfaces on the tail’s vertical stabilizer via sweeping jet actuators, thereby reducing material use and fuel utilization. In addition, these sweeping jet actuators allow for enhanced control of other critical components of the aircraft.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Open Loop Pointing Technique for Orbital Laser Communications,These inventions are components of a satellite based communication system using nanosatellites called CubeSats. These cube-shaped satellites developed by NASA are approximately four inches with a volume of about a quart and weighing three pounds.

"Design and Synthesis of Pro-Drugs for Selective, Oral Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract","This invention provides a method for oral administration and targeted delivery of pro-drugs bonded to a carbohydrate-based molecular scaffold to the gastrointestinal tract, where the pro-drug is released directly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by nitroreductase enzymes naturally present. This technology provides a means of delivery of GI therapies for a number of indications without requiring metabolism through the liver or other systemic exposure.","As one example of GI disease, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there.  Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon.",Life Sciences

Segmented Optical Component,This technology combines diffraction and refraction in a multi-order diffractive optical surface that is an extension of Fresnel lens technology that reflects numerous orders of wavelengths in a wide bandwidth that is constrained by the refractive dispersion of the lens. This has the advantage of collecting and focusing broader wavebands of light than standard achromatic lenses but at a fraction of the volume and weight.,"Currently, there are a number of reflective and refractive systems that are used in different types of optical applications. Fresnel lenses with shaped optical surfaces were proposed for large telescopes in the early 2000s in order to reduce volume and weight for space telescope applications. National research centers, like Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, proposed large scale thin membrane lens with Fresnel surfaces in the late 1990s. Ophthalmic uses for combinations of Fresnel surfaces in a single lens appeared in the mid 2000s with patents for progressive lenses.
 
The proposed technology is an engineered Fresnel diffractive surface lens that could potentially replace complex optical systems for a fraction of the cost and weight.

Retinal Resolution and Single-Chip Multiplexed Image Transfer for AR Near-to-Eye Displays,"This invention is a single-chip, field of view (FOV) selective, and variable resolution image projection design for augmented reality near-to-eye displays (AR-NEDs). The disclosure lays out the design for a multiplexed full color image transfer via single image guide, to achieve design requirements such as full color, 90 degrees FOV, and retinal image resolution.","For mobile augmented reality near-to-eye displays (AR-NEDs), reduction of size, weight, cost, and power of display optics is highly anticipated while increasing resolution, field of view (90 degrees in horizontal full FOV), optical efficiency, and the eye box size to accommodate FOV. Among display components/optics, holographic waveguide employed for AR-NED is one of the bottle necks that limits FOV up to several tens of degrees per single color. Moreover, pixel counts exceed the state-of-the-art of micro displays if the entire FOV of 90 degrees supports retinal resolution. Headsets are currently being used widely for entertainment, creative purposes, designing, medicine, therapy, business management and training. The result of this tech is that it demonstrates power efficient, full color, retinal resolution, and 90 degree FOV display within a single layer waveguide design.",Imaging & Optics
Co-doping of Holmium (Ho) and Dysprosium (Dy) with Erbium (Er) for Low-Cost High-Efficiency Diode-Pumped Laser at 3-Micron Meter Wavelength Range,"For many applications, the output of a laser diode is coupled into an optical fiber to direct the light beam more easily. This fiber can be doped with rare earth metals such as Erbium to increase efficiency and absorption. Instead of using Erbium (Er3+) exclusively for doped fiber lasers, this method proposes the use of codoped Er3+ fiber lasers with Holmium (Ho3+) and Dysprosium (Dy3+). Current Er3+-doped lasers can only reach the 2.8-2.9 micron wavelength range but deliver a high power output. Ho3+/ Dy3+-doped lasers lack the power output of Er3+-doped lasers but are able to reach wavelength regions above 3 microns. By codoping Ho3+ and Dy3+with Er3+, compact all-fiber lasers above 3-micron meter can be developed with the use of readily available, high power, and efficient diode lasers.","Erbium is the most common rare earth element used in fiber lasers because the available atomic energy levels for excitation and decay better match light energy output (wavelengths) from cheaper diode sources. Fiber laser beam quality is high and the power output is over 6kW, which is very high compared with a traditional gas or crystal laser. Fiber lasers are also efficient (70%-80%) which means they consume less power and are easier to cool. Because the beam remains focused within a fiber, it can be very small which makes fiber lasers an excellent source for laser cutting.

A fiber laser requires an energy source, such as 980nm pumped light from a laser diode coupled to the fiber, to produce the beam. This light energy source stimulates emission in the doped material of the fiber which creates the beam along the laser fiber. Emission is generally lower energy than the pumped energy – 1535nm compared with 980nm – but some heavy metal fluoride upconversion fiber lasers (ZBLAN) use multiple stimulated phonon transitions to produce higher energy emissions (480nm output with 1140nm input). ZBLAN fiber lasers may also be used for longer wavelength emission in the “eye-safe” region beyond 1400nm though output power remains lower than for shorter wavelengths.",Imaging & Optics
Rayleigh-Raman Polychromatic Laser Guide Star,A Rayleigh-Raman polychromatic laser guide star is implemented in an adaptive optics system to allow for the measurement of the tilt at the wavelength of observation. This technology makes use of the dispersion of the refractive index of and on or more differential tilt measurements at multiple wavelengths returned from the Rayleigh-Raman spectrum.,"Adaptive optics systems require wavefront tilt compensation. Existing tilt measurement systems rely on light from a source that traverses the medium in a single. Laser guide stars create a reference source anywhere in the field of view to enable a wavefront measurement through turbulence. However, many existing laser guide stars cannot act as a tilt measurement reference source due to the double pass nature of the reference light. The technology is an improvement upon current technologies and will allow for the measurement of the tilt at the wavelength of observation. This method is scalable and offers flexibility in selecting multiple lasers of different wavelengths to measure from.",Imaging & Optics
Novel Compounds that Selectively Inhibit HSP70 Isoforms for the Treatment of Cancer,"These compounds target a specific peptide binding domain of Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) isoforms. The method in which these compounds have been derived allows for HSP70 isoform specificity. Many HSP70 targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to the variety of HSP70 isoforms, and lack of specificity to a particular isoform.","Cancer cells have an increased burden on protein quality control machinery due to their rapid growth rates and the required transforming mutations that can produce unstable proteins. This increased need has led to the development of drugs targeting protein quality control pathways. HSP70s in concert with their co-factors HSP40s (J-Proteins) and nucleotide exchange factor (NEFs), use ATP binding and hydrolysis to catch and release unfolded polypeptides to prevent aggregation and give them the chance to reach their native, functional state. Many cancers have increased levels of a given HSP70 isoform, leading to increased survival and chemoresistance, making HSP70s potential drug targets. Concerns for HSP70s drugability have been raised because of the difficulties with isoform specificity, there are 13 HSP70 isoforms described in humans. Diverse studies and evaluations of patient samples have indicated differential up-regulation of HSP70s, arguing for isoform selective compounds as both probes and potential therapeutics.",Life Sciences
Close Range PET,"This invention involves moving the detector ring of a PET system closer to the patient while improving the spatial resolution and reducing the blurriness of resulting images.

Curved Combiner,The Curved Combiner is an improvement on flat waveguide head-up (i.e. windshields) and near to eye displays (i.e. glasses). The curved nature of the invention allows for image expansion and aesthetically pleasing hardware to be used in a diversified set of applications. The invention contains three holograms to redirect or expand the light that passes through the curved waveguide. Each hologram has a different function to ensure that the image has no aberrations which can occur when using curved waveguides.,"Waveguides are currently being produced using flat glass pieces. The advantage of flat waveguides is the small chance of image aberrations when injecting an image through the waveguide. However, flat waveguides limit the opportunity for image expansion and real-world applications. Current systems are bulky and limit integration capabilities. To address this issue, the present invention describes a curvature of the waveguide. The curvature allows the invention to be integrated into more modern applications.",Imaging & Optics

A New Device to Treat Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Through Neuromodulation,"This invention is a method of treating pulmonary arterial hypertension without the use of drugs. The invention describes a system for bilateral electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that can be implanted in the human body with the goal of ameliorating symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This device can be used with neonatal populations, where there have been limited therapies approved.","Pulmonary hypertension is a group of diseases characterized by elevated blood pressure in the lungs. There are five types defined by the World Health Organization, each based on the root cause of the elevated blood pressure. All types of pulmonary hypertension are serious, and if untreated, can lead to right heart failure and even death--group 3 pulmonary hypertension has a 1-year mortality of 46%, followed by group 2 at 40.9%. Among neonatal patients, there are limited therapies and drugs that have been approved for the treatment of PAH. Currently nitric oxide is an existing treatment, but it is not widely used. Pulmonary hypertension is currently not curable, but its symptoms can sometimes be managed. Partly thanks to its “orphan” status, a number drugs have been recently developed to treat group 1 pulmonary hypertension directly, but other types are often approached in terms of treating the underlying disease or even surgically. There is a clear need for more and better therapies for pulmonary hypertension, given that the current drugs are expensive, can have unpleasant side effects, and cannot be applied to all groups of pulmonary hypertension. This invention has the potential to fill that gap, and provide a way of treating all groups of pulmonary hypertension with few to no side effects.",Healthcare Portfolios
High Verdet Constant Polymer Magnetic Nanoparticle Materials for Magneto-Optic Devices,"University of Arizona researchers have developed high Verdet constant thin films using polymer-nanoparticle composite material.

These materials are known as “Faraday Rotators” due to their property of rotating the polarization of light when placed in a directed magnetic field, and are used in optical rotators, optical isolators and optical circulators. For example, high-powered lasers need optical isolators to prevent light reentering the laser possibly causing damage to the laser. The most commonly used high Verdet constant materials are Terbium Gallium Garnets (TGG). These materials are expensive as well as somewhat difficult to manufacture. Other options exist but are also generally expensive and/or are difficult to manufacture.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Single Copy Level Detection of Virus through Particle Counting on Paper Microfluidics Using Smartphone Based Fluorescence Microscope,University of Arizona inventors have detected norovirus on a microfluidic paper analytic device without using any sample concentration or nucleic acid amplification steps. This technology uses a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and an image-processing algorithm to isolate the particles aggregated by antibody-antigen binding. This leads to a limit of norovirus detection as low as 1 genome copy/µL in deionized water and 10 genome copies/µL in reclaimed water.,"Noroviruses are a group of non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause inflammation of the stomach or intestines. They are human enteric viruses that can be highly infectious upon ingestion of low doses of virions. In principle, norovirus can be detected in water, food, and environmental specimens. However, this current process involves complicated concentration of viruses and/or amplification of the norovirus genome, thus the detection is almost impossible in field settings.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
"Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) Control Using Plant-Derived Natural Extracts, and Thereof","This technology is an antimicrobial phytogenic supplement to therapeutically treat Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) in shrimp.

Plant-derived extract NE05 is effective at controlling AHPND and potentially other bacterial pathogens in shrimp, and it is the most efficacious among the natural extracts screened. NE05 is a potential candidate to develop AHPND therapeutic treatment and is delivered directly in the shrimp diet.","Shrimp is the single most popular seafood item per capita in the United States. In 2013, 1.1 billion pounds of shrimp sold in the U.S. were imported from foreign aquaculture operations, representing $5.3 billion. To satisfy the increasing demand for shrimp, intensive aquaculture systems have been developed to raise shrimp in smaller spaces. However, intensive farming with high stocking density exacerbates disease problems, despite added antibiotics intended to limit the growth of bacteria. In addition to creating poor culture conditions, these types of unsustainable systems can cause many public health problems, including harm to the environment and to workers, and the overuse of antibiotics, including those critical for human medicine.

Repurposed FDA-Approved Drugs as an Optical Biopsy Stain Panel,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a technology that repurposes FDA approved drugs to stain tissues <em>in vivo</em>, to enhance the effectiveness of optical biopsies. Alternatively, the cell staining panel could be a safer alternative to typical cell stains <em>ex vivo/in vitro </em>for routine optical microscopy.","Biopsies are a common medical practice to determine the presence or extent of a disease by examining sample cells or tissues from a patient. If imaging cannot properly diagnose a patient, a biopsy is usually the next step. The optical biopsy is a bit different from the common biopsy. Rather than taking a piece of the patient to the microscope, an optical biopsy takes a microscope tip into the patient to examine the tissues. This invention looks into the use of FDA approved drugs to stain the tissues in vivo to enhance the effectiveness of optical biopsies.",Imaging & Optics
Proteins from Asthma-Protective Amish Farm Dust,"This technology involves eight proteins that have been identified from fractions of Amish farm dust, which have been shown to protect against asthma in mice models. These eight proteins consist mainly of environmental allergens that can induce an immune response and have the potential to be utilized for allergen immunotherapy to help protect against and treat asthma.","Over 300 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, a condition that is characterized by the inflammation of the airways making it difficult to breathe. Current strategies to prevent asthma rely on long term medication and preventative measures such as avoiding triggers like physical exertion or known allergens. The exact cause of asthma is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors have been shown to play a role in the development of asthma. Recent studies in Amish children have shown that they display a much lower rate of asthma prevalence compared to other populations. In particular, exposure to Amish farm dust appears to play a role in lower asthmatic incidences within the children of Amish communities. During its development, this technology explored different components found within the Amish farm dust and screened them for their ability to protect against asthma, which revealed eight target proteins that may have the potential to proactively prevent the induction of asthma as well as treat current cases of asthma.",Healthcare Portfolios
New Strategies to Block RIPK1/3/MLKL-Mediated Neurodegeneration,"University of Arizona researchers have discovered several small molecules that represent a new class of RIPK1/3 targeting therapeutics that can potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease. These molecules inhibit necroptosis, which is a cell death pathway related to neurodegenerative diseases. Necroptosis is form of cell death which is activated by inflammation.","Finding disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias is critical. The prevalence of dementia is rising rapidly with over 50 million people afflicted world-wide and is anticipated to grow to 82 million by 2030. The accompanying global healthcare burden reached $1.1 trillion dollars in 2018 and is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2030.
 
The path to finding disease-modifying treatments for AD has been challenging, but also represents enormous opportunity for research and investment. Since 1998, there have been 100 attempts to develop an effective drug treatment; however, only four drugs, falling into two categories have been approved. A fifth drug, Tacrine, was discontinued because of serious adverse events and a sixth drug which is a combination of two approved drugs. These drugs treat AD symptoms. The pipeline through 2018 looked promising; however, several of pipeline drugs have failed during subsequent clinical trials.

Automated Lipid Exchange-Mass Spectrometry System,"This invention is an automated label-free method to measure the affinity of membrane proteins for lipids by using conventional small molecule mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor lipid exchange between lipoprotein nanoparticles called nanodiscs. We call this method lipid exchange-mass spectrometry (LX-MS). The concept is that if a membrane protein binds a certain type of lipid, it will shift the equilibrium distribution of lipids between empty (tagged) nanodiscs and membrane protein (untagged) nanodiscs. We quantify the equilibrium distribution by measuring the lipid composition in the membrane protein nanodiscs after exchange. By titrating the lipid composition, we can determine the optimal ratio of lipids surrounding a membrane protein. This assay should be general to any membrane proteins or lipids and uses small amounts of samples.","Membrane proteins make up the majority of drug targets yet only account for 2–3% of high-resolution structures. Thus, there is a great need for improvements in structural biology and drug discovery with membrane proteins. One important question is how membrane proteins interact with lipids and remodel their local lipid environment. It is clear that the lipid environment can be critical for membrane protein structure and function, but there are no methods to measure the optimal lipid composition for membrane proteins. Current methods of screening different lipid compositions are inefficient and costly.",Research Tools

One enterovirus, the polio virus, reached epidemic proportions in the early 1900s, causing paralysis in many people. While polio has been eliminated in most developed countries, the other enteroviruses are just beginning to cause serious disease. In 2014, almost 2,000 people in the United States and Canada alone were infected with EV-D68, a virus that had been rarely seen before. In certain cases, EV-D68 can cause a form of paralysis, similar to polio. EV-A71 has been associated with hundreds of thousands of cases of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in Asia since 2008. Finally, coxsackievirus B3 is implicated in viral myocarditis, which is a disease that may cause up to 10% of cases of acute onset heart failure.
 
Enteroviruses are becoming an important issue in virology and health around the globe. However, a vaccine has only been developed for EV-71A to date, and none of these viruses have effective antivirals for treatment once infection has occurred. Thus, it is extremely important to develop antivirals for the treatment and prevention of these infections.",Healthcare Portfolios
"pH Releasable Linkers for Drug Delivery, Imaging, or Diagnostics","This technology describes water-soluble triazabutadienes as cross-linkers to and protecting groups for small-molecule therapeutics or fluorescent moities. Upon changes in chemical conditions, triazabutadienes release a highly reactive diazonium species, enabling targeted delivery of the cross-linked molecule.","Cross linking is becoming a valuable practice in chemistry, including for life science applications, with the advent of mass spectrometry. Using cross-linking and ""click-chemistry"" can enable unique chemical manipulations of linked proteins for various purposes, including drug delivery, diagnostics, and research.  Numerous factors can limit the usefulness of reagents, with solubility and pH being two primary factors.",Life Sciences
Targeted Therapy for Itch,TMEM184B is a relatively uncharacterized 7-pass transmembrane protein that is a member of the Transporter-Opsin-GPCR (TOG) superfamily of proteins. It was discovered that over-expression of TMEM184B caused a reduction in scratching in response to interleukin-31 (Il-31) exposure. This was surprising given previous studies had shown that knock-out of TMEM184B resulted in a reduction in Il-31 induced scratching.  Increasing the activity and/or abundance of TMEM184B in a patient may be used to treat itch.,"Chronic itch affects up to 15% of the population. It may be caused by inflammation or more serious diseases of the kidneys, liver, nerves, and cancer. Chronic itch can impair quality of life, leading to disrupted sleep and anxiety / depression.
 
Somatosensory neurons transduce multiple types of stimuli, including temperature, chemical, and physical changes in the local environment of their nerve endings. Nerve endings receiving these cues can also directly sense inflammatory compounds, and this inflammation alters their response properties to cause hyperalgesia (heightened responses to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (painful responses to non-noxious stimuli). A common consequence of increased skin inflammation is the triggering of itch.
 
Acute and chronic itch are significant morbidities in humans. Itch-causing pathological conditions have a variety of causes, including skin disorders (atopic dermatitis), drug-induced reactions, systemic disorders such as liver disease, and other neurological disorders. The sensation of itch is distinct from pain and is carried by a subset of itch-specific somatosensory neurons called pruriceptive neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Skin itch is triggered by release of pro-inflammatory compounds such as cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and histamine from mast cells and epithelial cells, which act upon membrane receptors and channels present in epidermal nerve endings. In addition to chemical itch, mechanical stimuli can evoke similar itch sensations but rely on a distinct spinal circuit.",Healthcare Portfolios
Affinity Peptide Conjugated with Antioxidant for Protection of Proteins from Oxidation,This invention is a targeted peptide conjugated with an antioxidant to inhibit Akt1 nitration. It can be utilized for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with potential application in other abnormal proliferative disorders such as cancer.,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disorder affecting 1.1 to 17.6 million adults per year with a prevalence of 6.6 to 26 million. This progressive disorder is characterized by angioproliferative vasculopathy in the pulmonary arterioles leading to endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation, dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis.
 
The pathology of the disorder is associated with the thickening/remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall. The Atk1 (Protein Kinase B) serine/threonine kinase pathway plays an important role in normal and pathological vascular development and functioning as well as in other cellular functions such as glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and transcription. Increased activation of the Atk1 signaling pathway is believed to play a role in PAH pathophysiology through inhibition of apoptotic signaling and promotion of cell survival.
 
Currently the disease remains incurable despite existing therapies which are largely ineffective. Patients are therefore limited to invasive heart-lung transplantation which is only available in limited surgical centers worldwide and which has only a 50% survival rate at 5 years. Thus, the present invention is a targeted peptide conjugated with an antioxidant, that acts as an inhibitor at the Atk1 nitration site associated with PAH pathological conditions.",Healthcare Portfolios
Cell Collection Device for Biological Analysis,"This technology is an improvement to a <a href=""https://inventions.arizona.edu/tech/Optical_Imaging_Falloposcope_for_Minimally_Invasive_Ovarian_Cancer_Detection"" target=""_blank"">falloposcope</a> designed with optical elements selected for detection of early stage ovarian cancer in fallopian tube epithelium. The cells collected by the falloposcope is grounded in a growing body of medical cytology research for earlier cancer detection. This cell collection device improvement focuses on site accuracy (collecting cells only from a limited area of interest) while maintaining ease of use and protection of the fallopian tube tissue. It may be implemented in one of the existing optical channels of the falloposcope under development.","Although rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late. Pelvic ultrasounds and the CA-125 blood test are generally accurate for detecting late stage III-IV ovarian cancer, but the survival rates are less than 30%, compared with &gt; 90% survival rates for cancer detected in early stages, I-II. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better early detection screening procedures, particularly for high risk women with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. A reliable early detection procedure would provide an option other than removal of all reproductive organs after 40 for high risk women.
 
Research includes examining early stage lesions on the surface of ovaries and fallopian tube epithelium. Access to the fallopian tubes through the cervix is a minimally invasive option because it does not involve surgery; instead, falloposcopic examination can be done in a clinic with mild sedation. However, to be effective, a falloposcope must be small enough to pass through the narrow 1mm opening from the uterus to the proximal portion of the fallopian tube but it must have sufficient resolution and field of view to image the 4cm wide fimbral portion of the tube approximately 10cm away.
 
Medical device companies have patented other cell collection devices, generally involving brushes or balloons to collect a sufficient sample size for analysis. However, these designs tend to have larger surface areas that would fail to discriminate between lesions and the surrounding healthy tissue.",Imaging & Optics
Blown Float Glass Lens Array and Method,"This technology is a method for shaping glass that is used in silicon PV panels. The method involves a floating liquid glass that is used to form a flat sheet and is then blown to fit the curve of the shape. Sophisticated shaping control yields surfaces that may be used for a variety of solar panel applications, including concentrated photovoltaic systems in which lenses focus solar power on higher efficiency solar cells for improved performance.","With the increase in the demand for renewable energy and push for solar panels, there has been a significant decrease as the demand and popularity of solar panels has increased. Solar panels have allowed individuals to generate energy from sunlight and have allowed individuals to decrease their fossil fuel consumption.
 
Currently, within the solar industry, there are issues with high costs and varying efficiency of solar cells. Solar panels can be expensive to manufacture and they are expensive for consumers. Most commercial solar panels operate at efficiencies of 15%-20% with higher efficiencies up to 40% available for concentrated photovoltaics with focusing optics and multi-junction cells. However, these higher efficiencies come with a higher price tag. A goal among producers of solar power is to find ways to lower cost while expanding the use of higher efficiency products.
 
The proposed technology offers a new method to manufacture solar panels that has the potential of lowering the cost without compromising efficiency.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Dual-Axis Tracker Using Lightweight Spaceframe Structures,This technology is a dual-axis tracker that is used in combination with a dish reflector to be used within a heliostat. The technology uses an azimuth structure that allows free vertical motion up and down the rotation axis and a full rotational motion about the axis.,"Heliostats are commonly used within renewable energy and solar products. They are used to direct sunlight towards a predetermined target. This can allow solar products to be more effective and efficient when converting solar energy. Currently, there are a variety of heliostat products that can be purchased. It is common to see the heliostats with either a single-axis tracking system or a dual-axis tracking system. Some issues that individuals are faced with are misalignment and being efficient. The proposed technology is a dual-axis tracking system that uses an azimuth structure. The proposed technology offers an improved material use efficiency and a large range for rotation. With the proposed technology structure and design, it limits the potential level of damages that could occur due to the environment. The proposed technology is able to maintain its structure and reduce the spillage of the sunlight.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Optical Gyroscope with Gain Medium and Circulating Light,"This technology is a novel design for a gyroscope, which uses a central component that contains an optical whispering gallery arrangement, comprising a small sphere with one index of refraction, embedded in a larger sphere with a different index of refraction. Unlike other gyroscopes, which use bidirectional light, this design uses unidirectional light and employs polarization for enhanced sensitivity.","Gyroscopes have long been used to sense angular velocity changes, but traditional mechanical, vibrational, or optical gyroscopes tend to be larger than desired for integration in photonic scale systems. This approach has the potential to obtain measurements from a much smaller package that consume less power than standard optical gyroscopes and offers different integration options than larger designs. Another challenge has been how to reduce lock-in effects (higher noise and drift) for low rotation rates and achieve accurate performance without high power consumption from multiple laser sources. Innovations in optical devices have shrunk many functions to photonics scales on the order or tens or hundreds of microns, but so far performance from optical gyroscopes on these scales has not achieved desired levels. There is strong interest in the community developing rate sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to develop these small-scale, accurate gyroscopes that are less sensitive to vibrational and thermal effects.",Imaging & Optics
Polishing Interface Coating Technology,This invention is a method of adhering pitch to a polishing lap that utilizes a non-Newtonian fluid. This advancement enhances the smoothing capabilities for a previously developed polishing tool or similar tools that use a non-Newtonian fluid.,Manufacturing of lenses requires expensive machinery including high precision grinding and polishing machines. There is a need for advanced polishing laps to optimize the quality and quantity of high-grade lenses. Optical products are rigorously tested and only the highest-grade lenses end up as finished products. This required rigor has a direct effect on profits for the optical instruments and lens manufacturing industry.,Imaging & Optics
Bifacial Spectrum Splitting Photovoltaic Module,This invention is a system that combines different methods of increasing photovoltaic energy output and overall efficiency. Each of the methods increase the output and when combined have the potential to significantly increase the output and module efficiency (up to 55.78% estimated increased energy yields compared to the standard common PV cells) without significantly increasing the manufacturing costs. The increased energy yields could lead to systems with lower LCOE (levelized cost of energy).,"Renewable energies address the rising concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels as the world’s main energy source. Solar energy is widely available, creating high potential for the implementation of photovoltaic solar energy conversion systems. However, the cost per watt ($/W) and cost per kilowatt-hour ($/kW-hr) performance of photovoltaic solar energy conversion is still poor compared to that available from fossil fuels and even other renewable energy sources. In order to make photovoltaic solar conversion systems more competitive the conversion efficiency must increase without significant increase to the system cost or decrease the cost of system.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Optomechanical Inertial Reference For Atom Interferometers,"This invention is a combination of two devices meant to increase the performance and accuracy of measurements gathered surrounding small-scale matter. It involves the use of a highly sensitive and compact optomechanical inertial sensor that is capable of both testing mass and acting as an inertial reference of atom interferometers simultaneously. These technologies are easily adapted to work together, avoiding entire redesign and new technology costs associated with a brand-new device. It also enhances performance, robustness and deployment capabilities for atom interferometric based inertial navigations systems, gravimeters and gradiometers.","In the field of fundamental research involving individual atoms, quantum theory and gravimetry, precise measurements are needed to learn about these micro-scale phenomena that have large-scale implications. Current technologies that can capture and analyze the movement and properties of individual atoms require immense precision.
 
In the field of spectroscopy, the field concerned with analyzing at the scale of an individual atom, new developments in research technology tools out-perform previous techniques in accuracy, size of the equipment, and the ability to gather more information. Such a development allows researchers to better gain an understanding of small-scale matter and therefore lead to tremendous breakthroughs and ultimately advance the field of science, and as a result, industry.",Imaging & Optics
Aberration Correction in Volume Holographic Optical Elements using Spatial Light Modulator Computer Generated Holograms,This invention is a proprietary approach to realizing a reconfigurable computer generated hologram. This approach uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to form a wavefront to correct for wavelength shift induced aberrations in volume holographic focusing elements.,"Volume holographic optical elements show great potential for use in constrained applications like augmented and virtual reality eyewear since they can be realized with high diffraction efficiency in thin film materials. However, one of the problems with volume holographic materials is that they are only sensitive at shorter wavelengths (i.e. less than 650 nm) while many applications require operation at longer near IR wavelengths. When a focusing type holographic element is formed at one wavelength and reconstructed at a different wavelength, aberrations in the reconstructed image result from an inability to match the phase and Bragg conditions across the aperture of the hologram. Several methods have been proposed to correct this problem, although none completely successful. This invention proposes an alternative approach to solving this problem.",Imaging & Optics
Modulators of Melanocortin Receptors for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety,This invention is the use of the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) ligand to treat depressive and anxiety disorders. MC5R antagonism is the proposed mechanism of action.,"Depression and anxiety often have similar treatment, but experiencing the full effects of current pharmacotherapy can range from weeks to months. Antidepressants and anxiolytics are associated with a number of side effects including an increased risk of suicidal thoughts in those taking antidepressants. Therefore, a novel pathway is needed for rapid onset with minimal side effects.",Healthcare Portfolios
Method for the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety,"This technology relates to a modified version of SHU9119, a peptide chain that is known to interact with Melanocortin. This modified version of SHU9119 can antagonize the Melanocortin 5 Receptor (MC5R), potentially enabling rapidly-acting drugs to target these receptors and provide therapeutic relief for those suffering from depression and other mood disorders.",Current treatments for depression include drugs with delayed therapeutic onset.  This technology has the potential to fill this unmet need with a therapy that is specific to MC5R for treating depression and other mood disorders.,Life Sciences

Evidence links this receptor to depression and mood disorders, allowing the invention to effectively treat certain mental disorders.",SHU9119 is a peptide chain that is known to interact with melanocortin receptors. The receptors themselves are a series of five receptors that are difficult to isolate for targeted drug therapy. The invention relates to a modified version of SHU9119 that can antagonize MC5R and rend it inert to further chemical reactions. This allows rapidly acting therapy to target these receptors and relieve those suffering from depression and other mood disorders.,Life Sciences
Method for the Treatment of Depression,"This invention involves utilizing a composition, PG-20N, to treat depression or anxiety. It is specifically designed to treat conditions with a selective melanocortin 5 (MC5R) antagonist. Melanocortins exert many biological activities in the brain including control of feeding, grooming, hyperalgesia, social and sexual behaviors, central regulation of inflammation, fever, and cardiovascular functions, as well as neurotrophic activities.","Depression and anxiety contribute significantly to death and disability worldwide, and they frequently occur together. While industry standard solutions widely accept antidepressants as treatment, they typically result in only modest therapeutic efficiency after weeks of administration. In addition to their mild effectiveness, antidepressants have serious side effects such as: initially worsening symptoms, nausea, increased appetite, insomnia and blurred vision to name a few. These antidepressants have been approved by the FDA as they remain the few acceptable solutions to signaling systems in the brain. Currently there is a demand for drugs that can target brain systems in order mitigate the symptoms that antidepressants can invoke.",Life Sciences

Hybrid Filament Creation for 3D Printing of Resorbable Bone Scaffolds,"This invention describes composite filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing, and the methods of their production. This novel blends of filaments have better properties for 3D printing bone scaffolds with improved degradation kinetics and functionalities.","Due to an aging global population, the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders is increasing. Today, small volumes of bone or bone-like materials are commonly used in a variety of treatments to help heal or fuse a patient’s bones as necessary. These bone grafts are generally autografts (bone sourced from the patient’s own body), or allografts (bone from another person’s body). Each type of graft has its own issues: taking bone from elsewhere in a patient adds cost, complexity, and pain for the patient to the procedure, and sourcing bone from another person leads to potential for rejection by the immune system. Bespoke, patient-specific bone scaffolds that can be made on demand are being developed to circumvent these issues, through methods such as electrospinning and various types of 3D printing. Currently, most filaments available for purchase for use in fused deposition modeling-type 3D printers consist of a single type of material, which limits their chemical and mechanical properties. This invention are filaments composed of different materials with different properties, allowing the creation of 3D printed objects such as bone scaffolds with more tunable properties and more functionality, which can be used to satisfy the demand for bone grafts in an era of increasing prevalence of musculoskeletal disease.",Healthcare Portfolios
Stable Nanodroplet for Medical Imaging,This technology improves on current nanodroplet technology that can be activated through ultrasound to form microbubbles for imaging or drug delivery. These novel nanodroplets have layers at the exterior shell making the droplets more thermally stable and capable of circulating in the body longer. The nanodroplets have unaffected ultrasound activation profiles that do not require higher ultrasound frequencies.,"Ultrasound imaging, also known as sonography, uses high-frequency sound waves to visualize the interior of the body. Ultrasound images can show movement of the body's internal organs as well as blood flowing through the blood vessels in real-time. Unlike X-ray imaging, however, there is no radiation exposure associated with ultrasound imaging. During an ultrasound exam, a transducer probe produces waves that bounce off of body structures and return to the probe. Calculating both the strength and time it takes for the wave to travel through the body provides the necessary information to then produce an image. Microbubbles are among the most effective type of contrast agent available for ultrasound imaging. During ultrasound resonance, microbubbles emit a unique fingerprint-like signal that can be detected to generate imaging inside the body. Additionally, microbubbles consist of porous membranes that can transport therapeutic agents across natural barriers. The implementation of microbubbles in the preceding decades has enhanced the clarity of ultrasound imaging and opened the door for targeted drug delivery. Innovations that increase the stability and decrease the size of microbubbles have expanded their potential in imaging and drug delivery.",Imaging & Optics
Disrupting Mosquito Eggshell Formation by Targeting A Highly Diverged Biological Pathway,"This technology is a new method to control mosquito populations by disrupting mosquito-specific proteins important for embryonic development. Based on a bioinformatics study, a mosquito-specific regulatory protein, Eggshell Organizing Factor 1 (EOF1), was discovered, which is highly diverged from other species. EOF1 controls the synthesis of eggshell proteins from mosquito follicular epithelial cells. Experiments on mosquitos demonstrated that disrupting the biology of this eggshell formation pathway in the female mosquito after a blood meal results in non-viable eggs.","Approximately 80% of the global population is threatened by vector-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, West Nile Virus, zika virus and various encephalitis diseases. Increasing insecticide resistance exacerbates this problem, and insecticides may also harm non-target populations. The transmission of mosquito-borne diseases has become so problematic that both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization have made mosquito vector control a central feature of their organizational goals. Mosquitocides with new modes of action that are not also harmful to other species are needed. In addition, the Aedes aegypti mosquito breed have drought-tolerant eggshells, making them difficult to eliminate.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Methods for Practical Synthesis of Deuterated Aldehydes,"This technology is an organocatalytic strategy that enables directly converting readily accessible aldehydes to their 1-deutero counterparts. The approach is distinct from the reported transition metal catalyzed ionic hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDE) processes. The power of this new process has not only been demonstrated for aromatic aldehydes, but also for aliphatic substrates, which have been difficult for HDE, and for selective late-stage deuterium incorporation into complex structures with uniformly high deuteration level (&gt;90%).","Among isotopes, deuterium has perhaps the broadest impact on almost every sub-discipline in the life, chemical, material, and nuclear sciences and beyond. The recent surge in applications of deuterated pharmaceutical agents has been witnessed by the FDA approval of the first deuterated drug, austedo (deutetrabenazine), in 2017, as well as the large number of emerging deuterated drug candidates. This has created an urgent demand for synthetic methods that enable the efficient generation of deuterated building blocks.",Life Sciences
Diagnostic for Monitoring Response to Immunotherapies for Gynecologic Cancer,"This invention is a collection of immunological checkpoint proteins and physiological markers to diagnose and potentially monitor treatments for cervical cancer. This biomarker panel would be taken using the cervicovaginal lavage method, which is less invasive than other sampling methods for cervical cancer. This diagnostic test could be used not only for diagnosing cervical cancer, but also monitoring a patient's response to immunotherapy. It could also be utilized in precision medicine to determine which immunotherapeutic regimen would be the most effective for a particular individual.","Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women with an estimated 570,000 new cases in 2018, representing 6.6% of all female cancers. The overall five-year survival for all stages of cervical cancer is only 68% with overall survival for advanced cervical cancer being 16.8 months. There are only two FDA approved immunotherapy options for the treatment of recurred or metastasized cervical cancer: anti- VEGF antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD-1. However, only 20% of patients respond positively to anti-PD-1 treatment. A large portion of those that do respond to treatment also have large toxicity issues. A collection of immunological biomarkers sampled from vaginal cells could help decrease both incidence of cancer and morbidity by helping create customized therapeutic treatment regimens for patients.",Healthcare Portfolios

Alkali Metal Doped Graphene as Solid Hydrogen Storage System,University of Arizona researchers have developed an alkali metal ion doped graphene that is used as a material for a hydrogen storage system.,"The majority of currently commercially available materials used for storage systems are metal. Using metal causes the system to be heavy and have a low gravimetric density. Other materials require extreme temperature and pressure conditions to control the hydrogen adsorption and desorption process. Hybrid materials require chemical or mechanical activation at a high temperature. These materials and their drawbacks are why the material is not suitable for large-scale safe commercial storage system. This invention focuses on the development of a low cost, high yield synthesis of alkali metal ion doped graphene that is also able to withstand pressure while still maintaining to charge with hydrogen. This technology possesses the potential to become the first commercialized hydrogen storage system.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
White Light Interferometry Imager,This technology is an EDOF system that maintains high lateral resolution while extending the depth of field. It is based on white light interferometry but adds a feature where the interferometer scans through the different depths of an object to create a depth map.,"White light interferometry offers a solution to the age-old trade-off in optics between depth of field and lateral field of view. Using white light interferometry, contrast fringes in interference images appear near zero optical path difference and best focus. By scanning through a range of height positions and integrating the resulting 3D data cube into a final 2D image, one can create a focused, full-color 2D object image. However, this process is both data collection and processing intensive. This project proposes a method to reduce both data collection time and the degree of post-processing needed to create a final focused image.
 
The relative phase between the signal and reference of the interferometer is not taken into account when examining the contrast fringes. The most accurate height measurements with height resolution on the order of 0.5 nanometers are from systems using best focus from contrast fringes and phase-shift data to correlate phase differences to surface height deltas. This project uses the contrast fringes for best focus measurements for height resolution on the order of microns.",Imaging & Optics
On-Chip CMOS Threshold Processing,"This technology is a method of processing the interference fringes produced by the UA19-178 system. It employs a threshold-type operation at the incoherent light level so that only constructive interference is recorded, which greatly speeds up the data processing by reducing the amount of data to process in the first place. Processing occurs on the sensor to manipulate the raw signal into the desired form. The sensor’s circuit elements transform the data from each pixel without sending the signal off-chip, thus avoiding the bottleneck effect that occurs from serially transferring the data.","Event-based vision sensors offer a radical departure from traditional synchronous (frame-based) sensors. Rather than collecting data from an array of pixels at set times, these sensors provide a stream of asynchronous events corresponding to a specified change at a particular pixel address. This means that vision sensors can respond to changes ten times faster than traditional video cameras running at 60 hz while providing data of interest rather than redundant or stale data. However, challenges remain to processing the asynchronous output stream and calibrating pixels’ response within the extensive dynamic range of the sensor.
 
Threshold processing refers to the circuitry that processes the detectable signals from photo-sensitive elements and converts the signals to digital output that is interpreted by downstream algorithms. Concerns of precision and noise guide choice of circuit design, as well as cost.",Imaging & Optics
Digital Illumination Assisted Gaze Tracking,"This invention describes a better design for a wavefront sensor that can capture all the desirable traits of a wavefront sensor in one package. It takes the best attributes of the two most well known wavefront sensors (Shack-Hartmann type and Pyramid type). Alone, these two wavefront sensors can only achieve 1-2 of the three ideal wavefront sensor properties: high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and linearity. This novel wavefront sensor allows for all three properties to be realized in single sensor design.","Wavefront sensors are at the forefront of adaptive optics, a field that has seen massive interest and growth, and continues to have incredible potential. An essential element of any adaptive optics system is having an effective wavefront sensor that can identify any aberrations in the optical data collected. This is particularly important as current wavefront sensors have a tradeoff between their properties and none allow for all of the ideal properties to be reached. Currently, wavefront sensors are used at telescopes for military space surveillance as well as astronomical purposes.",Imaging & Optics
Essential Oil Microemulsions and Plant Extracts to Prevent Biofilm Formation,"This technology surrounds the usage of plant extract microemulsions for the prevention of biofilm formation on food contact surfaces and medical devices. These microemulsions are non-toxic, plant-based, and are effective against known biofilm-forming pathogens such as Salmonella sp., E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. This invention presents a safe and natural way to prevent the formation of biofilms, thereby reducing the risk of contamination of ready-to-eat food products and potentially medical devices.","The term “biofilm” refers to a colony of prokaryotic organisms that have aggregated together, forming a thick film with a protective layer of polysaccharide that is tightly adhered to a surface. Biofilms are particularly troublesome because when protected by the polysaccharide matrix, the bacteria inside can become up to 1,000 times more resistant to disinfectants than when suspended. As a result, biofilms can be difficult to remove once formed, and represent a source of contamination in both the food and medical device industries that can be very challenging to eliminate.
 
Biofilms are a serious issue in both the medical device and food industries. In the early 2000s, 50-70% of hospital acquired infections manifesting between 2 and 30 days were implant-associated, representing 1-1.4 million cases. Treatment of biofilms in medical devices is very challenging as the above current techniques for removal, such as the use of disinfectants, cannot be used in humans, and antibiotics are often ineffective. Often, surgical replacement must take place if symptoms persist, which can be expensive and risky.
 
In the food industry, biofilms can cause outbreaks of disease if the food product becomes contaminated. Biofilms in food production and processing are usually chemically treated, with chlorine-based sanitizers being the most common. Hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and quaternary ammonium compounds are also often used.
 
The most effective treatment of biofilms is to prevent bacteria from attaching to the surface and initiating the formation of the biofilm. This invention can prevent biofilm formation, and is likely to be safe for use in both the food industry and medical devices.",Agriculture & Horticulture

A Method for Unsupervised Change Detection Using Deep Learning,"This invention is a method of auto-detecting a change in data trends. As a data stream changes in characteristics, it may trigger other events, predict future performance, or assess a business’ health, among other things. Specifically, the invention looks to analyze high dimensional time-series data. This data appears in numerous applications, including healthcare, financial transactions, network traffic measurements, and Internet of Things (IoT). This invention presents a method for efficiently detecting abnormal changes in the underlying statistics of high-dimensional data streams in a completely unsupervised manner.","Detecting changes in a data stream is an important area of research with many applications. In many applications, data is not static but arrives in data streams. Besides the algorithmic difference between processing data streams and static data, there is another significant difference. Change detection can be broken down into the following two categories: Value Change Detection and Aggregation Change Detection.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Automated Conversion of Corrosion Current to Corrosion Rate,"This invention is an automated program to be used to convert corrosion data derived from polarization (current vs. voltage) curves to corrosion rates in units of micron per year. The automated analysis calculates corrosion rates in an unambiguous and automatic way. It is less time-consuming and arbitrary than the conventional graphical analysis used currently. The data analysis is used in an automated test station which is currently being developed at the Water Energy Sustainable Technology (WEST) center in Tucson, Arizona. The data is of primary interest for converting electrochemical (I/V) data to corrosion rates (pipe metal loss rates). The crucial aspect of the invention is that it takes raw measured electrochemical current and voltage data and gives a metal loss rate and corrosion potential.","Throughout the world, society is powered by often unseen pipes that transport water and other products through pipes. Because of the importance of such pipes, there is the constant need to ensure they are working properly. This helps to reduce costs and prevent destruction caused from leaks. Leaks themselves can often be caused by corrosion of pipes. This invention helps to address that problem.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
A Modular Running Shoe with Individually Optimized Replaceable Heel,This technology relates to footwear featuring replaceable sole portions. Through replaceable soles the technology can increase the lifetime of shoes and allow for optimization of shock absorption based upon a specific individual.,"Soles on running shoes have a two major flaws. They only have a specific lifetime as the soles can wear out based upon the amount of use undergone. Runners typically have to change shoes as tread wears and causes a decay in performance. Also, shoes are mass produced and their performance, especially in terms of shock absorption, is not likely to be idea for specific individuals.

This product can be used in a warehouse or greenhouse type of vertical farm/plant factory. The dimensions of the product can be adjusted to fit the entire available volume of space being used.","As urban populations continue to increase, and more people become interested in healthy produce, the need for efficient and plentiful farming is in high demand. Vertical farming systems can solve this issue, especially this one due to its unique features including stowability and being equipped with its own hydroponic unit and lighting board.",Agriculture & Horticulture
The i-Sprout Green Box,"This invention is an expandable and collapsible modular cultivation system intended for use in vertical farming or plant factories. It includes the capability to expand or retract in size to fit any volume or spacing restrictions, which efficiently maximizes crop productivity.","In an effort to reduce the amount of water and land used to cultivate crops, many farms have resorted to vertical farming and plant factory methods. These methods have shown to effectively produce crops with 97% less water than traditional farming arrangements. Due to the confined space in these facilities, many farmers seek ways to maximize the amount of space available to them. The i-Sprout Green Box helps resolve this issue by providing the market with an expandable/retractable growing tray system that can conform to various shapes and sizes in order to maximize the amount of space allotted.

"A Molecular Diagnostic Tool for Detecting Clostridium difficile Infection, Carriage and Outbreaks",This invention is an extremely sensitive and precise molecular diagnostic tool to accurately identify clostridium difficile strains.,"Clostridium difficile is a healthcare associated infection with significant patient mortality, morbidity, and may result in prolonged hospital stays. It is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections and represents a substantial healthcare cost burden. Rapid and early identification of toxigenic Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is important to the early and appropriate management and implementation of infection control measures resulting in improvement in patient outcomes. There are several current laboratory tests used to diagnose C. difficile. Tests that have high sensitivity and specificity are more difficult to perform, more costly, and take longer. Inexpensive, rapid tests may have low sensitivity depending on multiple factors.

Pharmacological Cognitive Protection of Bees Against Neuropesticides,"The technology, compositions and methods for protecting insect pollinators against the harmful cognitive effects of pesticides, is suitable for ingestion by an insect pollinator using standard feeding. The technology protects against pesticide-induced impairment of a cognitive function of the insect pollinator. Methods of using such compositions for preventing or reducing pesticide-induced impairment of cognitive functions including learning, memory, decision-making, and navigation protect insect pollinators including honeybees and bumblebees against neurotoxic pesticides including neonicotinoids such as Imidacloprid.","Research has shown that pesticides are large contributors to the decrease in pollinators. As a result of this research, many pesticides that have the effect on pollinators have been banned in Europe. The issue with simply banning a subset of pesticides, is that eventually, pests will become resistant to the pesticides still in use. Long term, crops will still suffer from pests that have become resistant to the remaining pesticides in use. This technology looks to overcome this challenge by increasing the resistance of bees to pesticides. This will allow the use of pesticides that help protect the crops without harming the bee population.",Agriculture & Horticulture

A Fast Compression Algorithm For Images And Video Capable Of Real-Time Speed,"This technology is an algorithm that provides real-time, high performance, “lossless” data compression.","Data compression algorithms, such as a zip file, reduce the number of bits needed to store or transmit digital information. The performance of the algorithms is often quantified in terms of a compression ratio. For example, 80% means that the compressed data would use 80% fewer bits than the original. The highest performance algorithms, such as those used to compress video for consumer applications (i.e. an mp4 video file) are “lossy,” which means that the information is discarded when it is judged to be not important to the presentation quality of the video. In many cases, in scientific applications such as astronomy, loss of information is unacceptable to the end product. Lossy algorithms typically do very well in both compression and decompression times, although they are optimized for decompression (i.e. playback). However, lossless algorithms, like the zip algorithm, are often very slow in both directions.",Software & Information Technology
Phyto-Mediated Wastewater Treatment Bioreactor (PWBR),"The Phyto-Mediated Wastewater Treatment Bioreactor (PWBR) is a process for treating various types of wastewater through removal of contaminants, including residual forms of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, heavy metals, etc. The PWBR can also remove Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC's) which include, but are not limited to, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds and engineered nanomaterials. PWBR is superior to industry alternatives due to the modularity and portability of the treatment system and its ability to target specific contaminants particular to individual cleaning projects.","Wastewater treatment is a process to remove contaminants from wastewater or sewage and convert it into an effluent that can be returned to the water cycle with minimum impact on the environment, or directly reused. New pollution problems have placed additional burdens on wastewater treatment systems. Today’s pollutants, such as heavy metals, chemical compounds, and toxic substances, are more difficult to remove from water. Rising demands on the water supply only aggravate the problem. The increasing need to reuse water calls for better wastewater treatment.
 
If wastewater is not properly treated, then the environment and human health can be negatively impacted. These impacts can include harm to fish and wildlife populations, oxygen depletion, beach closures and other restrictions on recreational water use, restrictions on fish and shellfish harvesting and contamination of drinking water.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Nematicidal Activity of three Secondary metabolites produced by the Entomopatogenic Bacteium Photorhabdus l. sonorensis,"University of Arizona researchers have discovered secondary metabolites that were isolated from P. l. sonorensis bacteria with potential use in nematicides.

In particular, this technology involves the use of biologically active secondary metabolites from insect pathogenic Photorhabdus bacteria, which have antibacterial antifungal, insecticidal and nematicidal properties, including properties against the root knot nematode.","Nematodes are parasitic worms that feed on living material. They can often be detrimental to plant growth and health as they attack and feed on plant roots. Nematodes occur in almost two-thirds of the fields which are organized for commercial crop and vegetable production. They can infest all parts of the plant leading to severe crop damages. The root knot nematode is known to be one of the most damaging parasites worldwide.

In particular, the attractive chemical accessibility and functional diversity of styrenic comonomers used with elemental sulfur to prepare a new chemical platform for sulfur-based polymeric materials and to further enable post-polymerization modifications for improving the properties of sulfur-based materials.","An incredible abundance of elemental sulfur, nearly 7-million tons is generated as a waste byproduct from hydrodesulfurization of crude petroleum feedstocks, which converts alkanethiols and other (organo) sulfur compounds into S8. Before the invention of the inverse vulcanization process, there were only a limited number of synthetic methods available to utilize and modify elemental sulfur. Current industrial utilization of elemental sulfur is centered around sulfuric acid, agrochemicals, and vulcanization of rubber. For example, elemental sulfur is used primarily for sulfuric acid and ammonium phosphate fertilizers, where the rest of the excess sulfur is stored as megaton-sized, above ground sulfur towers. While sulfur feedstocks are plentiful, sulfur is difficult to process. In its original form, elemental sulfur consists of a cyclic molecule having the chemical formulation S8. Elemental sulfur is a brittle, intractable, crystalline solid having poor solid-state mechanical properties, poor solution processing characteristics, and there is a limited slate of synthetic methodologies developed for it. Hence, there is a need for the production of new materials that offers significant environmental and public health benefits to mitigate the storage of excess sulfur in powder, or brick form.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
"High Power, Configurable, Pico-Second LED Driver","This technology is a light-emitting diode (LED) driver capable of driving 190mApp of current through an LED. The driver can drive various kinds of LEDs and multiple LEDs in series with up to a total forward voltage of about 8V. The LED is modulated at a single frequency of 200kHz, but future designs could modulate at 1MHz by substituting slower components with faster components. The driver has two levels of feedback:","As a result of continuous technological advances that have brought about remarkable performance improvements, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly finding applications in traffic lights, automobiles, general-purpose lighting, and liquid-crystal-display (LCD) backlighting. As solid state light sources, LED lighting is poised to replace existing lighting sources such as incandescent and fluorescent lamps in the future since LEDs do not contain mercury, exhibit fast turn-on and dimmability, and long life-time, and require low maintenance. Compared to fluorescent lamps, LEDs can be more easily dimmed either by linear dimming or PWM (pulse-width modulated) dimming. A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when its p-n junction is forward biased. While the color of the emitted light primarily depends on the composition of the material used, its brightness is directly related to the level of current flowing through the junction. Therefore, it is typically desirable for an LED driver circuit to generate a constant current.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Conjugation of the MCR1 Ligand with Cytotoxic Drugs for Targeted Melanoma Therapy,"University of Arizona researchers have developed a drug composition and method of cancer treatment using chemotherapeutics linked to ligands selective for uptake by melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) in MC1R-overexpressing melanoma. This development targets melanoma, and may be used with a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, to selectively deliver a toxic payload that may be less likely to result in melanoma treatment resistance and off-target effects of systemic exposure.","Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer in the United States, with an estimated 87,110 new cases and 9,730 deaths in 2017. Once metastasized, the median overall survival for malignant melanoma patients is 5.3 months. Despite recent breakthroughs for developing BRAF-V600E and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, current treatments can only improve survival, and tumor cells eventually become resistant to these treatments. The BRAF-V600E inhibitor vemurafenib was shown to prolong the median overall survival of patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma to 15.9 months. However, a mice study showed that 20% of melanoma tumors became resistant to vemurafenib treatment after 56 days. Similarly, 60% to 70% of metastatic melanoma patients are innately resistant to PD-1 inhibitor treatments. To increase response rate and avoid the resistance issue, there is a need for melanoma drugs that can target biological processes that are fundamental for cell proliferation or survival, so that the therapeutic effect cannot be easily bypassed through activation of a compensating signal pathway. Nevertheless, current anticancer agents that target cell proliferation or survival usually have poor selectivity to cancer cells and thus are also toxic to healthy non-cancer cells.",Healthcare Portfolios
Resident Evaluation System Application (RES App),"This is an application for students and faculty to access and transmit information related to resident evaluations. It features easy to use competency-based evaluations called EPAs; a notification system used to communicate expectations about the EPAs to the resident in advance of the rotation start; a notification system to assign EPAs to faculty. In addition, standardized evaluation forms from ACGME and ABS can also be communicated to and completed by faculty as requested by the student through the application.  The data gathered through the application and is uploaded into the evaluation system for analysis.","This application was originally developed because the system used by the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix Integrated Surgical Residency program to evaluate the students in the residency program was increasingly complicated. When systems are not user friendly or overly complicated, users are not motivated to use them and may avoid their use to altogether to the extent possible.  Complicated residency evaluation systems are no exception. Poor systems, that make communication and routine tasks difficult may ultimately results in low-quality feedback with little or no individualized comments for the resident. This also negatively impacts Clinical Competency Committees for whom high quality evaluations are essential.",Software & Information Technology

Inexpensive and Processable Polymer Magneto-Optic Nanoparticle Composites for Faraday Rotation: Plastic Garnet Optical Isolators and Sensors,"This invention includes methods and materials for producing high Verdet constant composite materials. Uses polymers as an inexpensive substrate in which certain types of nanoparticles are embedded. The invention includes detailed processes of how to embed the nanoparticles and prevent the nanoparticles from aggregating in the polymer. The result is an inexpensive material with a high Verdet constant, which can induce rotation of polarized light (faraday rotation) under the presence of a directed magnetic field.  The amount of high Verdet material required is significantly reduced, enabling smaller optical components which can be more closely integrated into optical systems.","Materials with a high Verdet constant are used in optical components for lasers and telecommunications. These materials are known as “Faraday Rotators” due to their property of rotating the polarization of light when placed in a directed magnetic field, and are used in optical rotators, optical isolators and optical circulators. For example, high-powered lasers need optical isolators to prevent light reentering the laser possibly causing damage to the laser. The most commonly used high Verdet constant materials are Terbium Gallium Garnets (TGG). These materials are expensive as well as somewhat difficult to manufacture. Other options exist but are also generally expensive and/or are difficult to manufacture.",Materials
Novel 5-Fluorouracil Prodrug For Colorectal Cancer Therapy,"This invention provides a method for a targeted delivery of a commonly used chemotherapy drug, 5-fluorouracil used to treat colorectal cancer. A pro-drug is released within the colon to release the active ingredient. The method will allow for targeted delivery of 5-fluorouracil to the colon.","Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there.  Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon.",Healthcare Portfolios
Advanced Engineered Formulations of Suramin Microparticles and Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery and Applications Therein,"This invention consists of new advanced formulations of the drug Suramin for administration by multiple routes. In addition, the invention surrounds the process and manufacturing of these newly formulated Suramin microparticles and nanoparticles so they can be effectively used in the treatment of wounds. Specifically, these new formulations would be utilized for wound healing purposes in mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers.","Oral mucositis is a consequence of chemotherapy and radiation treatment of head and neck cancer, the third most common cancers with nearly 550,000 cases per year. However, chemotherapy and radiation have horrible side effects, with the most common being ulcers and sores of the mouth and throat, otherwise known as mucositis. Nearly 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 100% of patients receiving radiation experience mucositis, which results in pain, trouble breathing and swallowing, and infections. In addition, diabetic foot ulcers occur in nearly 15% of all diabetic patients and precede nearly 85% of all diabetic related amputations. 
 
These serious complications of highly prevalent diseases have limited treatment options. If left untreated, mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers have horrible effects on patients ranging from pain and infections to the loss of a limb. This invention re-formulates Suramin to help promote wound healing. Currently, Suramin can only be administered intravenously, which means a medical professional must administer each dose and each dose is delivered invasively. This technology could potentially allow Suramin to be administered by more patient-friendly routes including non-invasive targeted routes. Early studies have already shown its effectiveness in increasing the healing process of diabetic related sores in a mouse model.",Healthcare Portfolios

Neurochemical Data Collection from In vivo Electrochemical Measurements,"This invention allows for the collection of real-time chemical analysis of neurotransmitters in the brains of lab animals via rapid application of voltage with resulting current measurement from microelectrodes. Tiny carbon-fiber electrodes are implanted into the animal, and electrochemical measurements are recorded, providing information to relate concentrations of neurotransmitters in the brain to behavior of the animal.","Understanding the complex functions of a brain remains one of the grand challenges of biomedical research. One possible way is to develop in vivo biosensors for monitoring the activities and the signal pathways of neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters are essential chemicals that can transfer information between the neuron cells. Hence, monitoring the concentrations of various neurotransmitters is of great importance in assessing brain function. A biochemical sensor that can continuously monitor the dynamic behaviors of the various neurotransmitters in real-time can be a powerful tool for monitoring and treating patients with neurological brain disorders.",Research Tools
Energy Efficient Switching In Magnetic Tunnel Junctions With An Antiferromagnetic Barrier,This invention is a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) design to realize more efficient switching. This design includes the use of an antiferromagnetic layer.,"Spintronics represents a promising solution to address the problem of greatly increased power consumption in CMOS transistors for memory and logic applications. Storing information as spin, instead of charge, spintronics offers a unique route to eliminate energy waste in the stand-by state. A large part of the present spintronics research focuses on reducing the dynamic power consumption and increasing the on/off ratio (magnetoresistance) in various structures. Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have been arguably the most important building blocks in spintronic technology.  There is a need for advanced MTJs that dramatically reduce switching energy while maintaining a reasonably high tunneling magnetoresistance and strong thermal stability at room temperature",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Baro-Balloon,"This invention is a new medical device designed to replace permanent and invasive methods of weight loss. The device itself is a series of balloons used to gradually decrease the space in the stomach to promote weight loss. Unlike current gastric balloon based interventions that are free-floating and meant to only be utilized in the short term, this technology can be attached to the abdominal wall and can be utilized for long term, sustained weight loss. The technology works to decrease the space in the stomach by increasing the volume in the balloons. This volume adjustment can be done by the physician but also can be controlled by the patient themselves. While surgery is required to place the balloon, the procedure can potentially be performed endoscopically or by an interventional radiologist allowing for lighter anesthesia. The device is not permanent and can be removed.","There are many different approaches used to address obesity depending on the individual patient and severity. Morbidly obese patients are potential candidates for various surgical options which are beneficial. However, these procedures are invasive and permanently alter the patient’s anatomy. Gastric balloon placements are considered an alternative to these invasive surgeries for lower BMI patients but most gastric balloon devices run the risk of deflation which can cause an obstruction because the balloons are free floating within the stomach.",Healthcare Portfolios
Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Nephrostomy Model,"This invention is a surgical training model for ultrasound-guided ablation of kidney stones. This model includes the following features for optimal surgical training: kidney structure, kidney stones, ribs, paraspinous muscle, and fluid drip.","Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a medical procedure to treat large kidney stone accumulation (stones larger than 2 cm), involving obtaining percutaneous access to the patient’s kidney. PCNL is a challenging procedure in part because of the complexity of obtaining safe access to the kidney. This procedure traditionally involved fluoroscopy, however that method exposed the patient and the medical team to harmful ionizing radiation. In addition, flouroscopic imaging has the potential to injure the skin or the renal capsule. PCNL can now be performed with ultrasound imaging alone. However, since this is still a new technique, there is a need for a training simulation model for ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrostomy.",Healthcare Portfolios

An Essential and Unique Virulence Molecule in Pathogenic Escherichia Coli,"This invention relates to a secreted protein that plays a critical role in mediating virulence of pathogenic E. coli. Utilizing a functionally equivalent mouse pathogen, in both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> virulence studies, the investigators demonstrated that the premature death of intestinal epithelial cells could be prevented.","There are no vaccine or antibiotic options to treat Enterohemorrhagic E. coli associated diarrhea. Pathogenic E. coli is also the leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. A secreted protein from E. coli prevents the premature death of intestinal epithelial cells by regulating the type III secretion system, which delivers virulence proteins from the pathogen to the host epithelial cells. There is an unmet need to develop a therapeutic option to prevent E. coli associated diarrheal disease.",Healthcare Portfolios
"Plant-Based Production of Protein Therapeutics, with Constructs, Method and System for Animal Delivery","This invention provides a method for creating protein therapeutics for treating (primarily) ulceration (throughout the body caused by a variety of diseases) by implementing an Endogenous Grown Human Growth Factor delivery system which is developed by genetic splicing of genes (conducive to produce growth factor proteins) into soybeans while simultaneously using a similar technique to repress plant genes that induce inflammatory, allergenic, or mutagenic responses within humans and animals.","Protein therapeutics have emerged as increasingly vital therapy for a wide range of conditions in animals and humans. For example, diabetic foot ulceration results in both acute and chronic wounds that are difficult to heal without growth factor administration often resulting in amputation of the foot or limb. Similarly, in children, necrotizing enterocolitis often leads to malabsorption, resulting in ultimate death without growth factor administration. While growth factors have increasingly been brought forward as biologic therapeutics, their production, processing, and means of target delivery to patient remains complex, expensive, and cumbersome.",Materials
Degradation of Aflatoxin B1 in Contaminated Maize,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed a method for removing Aflatoxin B1 from contaminated crops by using a specific type of fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus. Aflatoxin concentrations can be reduced from levels considered unacceptable for human or animal consumption to levels at which the products are safe to consume. Furthermore, the method leads to the generation of edible mushrooms free of aflatoxin.","Aflatoxins are cancer-causing chemicals that are produced by certain molds that grow in staple foods such as rice, peanuts, wheat, etc. Aflatoxins can also have other negative health effects including growth retardation, immune suppression, and even death. Following an investigation into the effectiveness of Pleurotus ostreatus in biodegrading aflatoxin B1, researchers at the University of Arizona have devised a method for degrading aflatoxins in staple foods to levels acceptable for use in livestock feed or for the generation of high quality food from contaminated sources by using the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus.",Agriculture & Horticulture

Virtual Deflectometry Enclosure Screen,This invention is a system designed to perform optical quality metrology on freeform or convex optics.  This system provides a full aperture surface reconstruction sag map of freeform surfaces. The method relies on the creation of virtual source enclosure that surrounds the unit under testing (UUT) and produces a virtual 2 Pi-steradian measurement range.,"Freeform optics provide many possibilities in the design of cutting-edge optical systems. However, their fabrication and metrology are challenging. To verify the freeform shape, two non-contact optical metrology methods are commonly used for UUT, interferometry and deflectometry. Interferometry offers high accuracy and precision in surface metrology. However, this method relies on prohibitively expensive computer-generated holograms and requires a null setup to obtain accurate results.  Deflectometry is an alternative non-null test method that relies on rays leaving a source, being deflected by a UUT. Convex optics both standard and freeform are highly challenging to measure. Interferometric approaches typically require measuring sub-apertures that are then stitched together. The required setup is not always a viable option. Deflectometry is used in 3D construction for surfaces up to weak convex surfaces; however; a full aperture optical precision test of general convex surfaces is yet to be achieved.",Imaging & Optics
Phase Unwrapping by Neural Network,This technology is a novel method for phase unwrapping in optical imaging in a more efficient and accurate way. It uses unwrapping algorithms based on a transport of an intensity equation with a convolutional neural network to unwrap the phase. This novel method uses a multi-class classification process and introduces an efficient segmentation network to identify classes. This allows for a more efficient and effective method in removing the ambiguity that occurs in a wrapped phase.,"Systems that use modern and mature algorithms to extract phase signals tend to return phases that involve phase jumps that produce inherently wrapped outputs that result in unusable phases. These unusable phases require the phase discontinuities to be removed by a phase unwrapping algorithm.
 
While there are many types of technology that involve and require the extraction of a phase signal from an input image, such phase unwrapping is a time-consuming process that makes it challenging for there not to be any errors when it is produced. Depending on the outcome of the process, the entire system can be affected. The outcome can involve thousands of individual phase wraps, false phase wraps caused by noise, or by the phase extraction algorithm itself. Differentiating between these is a complicated process and the errors can be spread throughout the entire image leaving the resulting image unusable. While there have been quite a few methods that have been developed that are used to try and meet this need, there isn’t a fully efficient process available. 
 
This technology is a more efficient process that removes 2Pi ambiguity while unwrapping at a quicker rate. It's also more efficient in reducing unwrapping errors that occurs in the current technology, which allows for the unwrapping process to become more accurate and less time-consuming.",Imaging & Optics

However, the resonator has to have a smooth surface to allow the capture of light at different wavelengths. The ability of a resonator to capture light effectively is referred to as its Q-factor (quality factor). Traditional ways of smoothing the surface of a resonator still leave too much residual roughness that leads to a lower q-factor, and thus less accurate detection of biomarkers.",Imaging & Optics
Inhibitors of the DNA - KU70/80 Association to Sensitize Cells for Radiation or Chemotherapy,"This invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting cancer cell survival and/or promoting cell death following radiation or chemotherapy applied in cancer treatment. This invention is a second set of Ku70/80 inhibitors that can sensitize cancer cells for chemotherapy. A first set of Ku70/ 80 inhibitors was previously discovered by University of Arizona researchers (UA14-189). Ku70/80 is a protein that repairs radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), causing the cancer treatment process to be prolonged. UA19-131 in combination with UA14-189 would prevent Ku70/80 from binding to DNAs so that they cannot perform the DNA repair function.","Radiotherapy is a key component in the management of 40% of cancer patients cured of their disease. It is a highly effective treatment strategy and is one of the most cost-effective treatment modalities in oncology2. For all tumors, there is a dose-response curve that indicates better control with higher doses of radiation. Radiation therapy, however, can damage normal cells as well. As a result, researchers are searching for drugs that make tumor cells easier to kill when combined with radiation therapy to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The FDA granted approval to a combination of radiotherapy with a targeted agent in March 2006, but no new drug-radiotherapy combinations have been approved since2.

G-Quadruplex Targeting Small Molecules for the Treatment of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer and HSV-1,"This technology consists of a new class of small-molecules that target G-quadruplex formation. These compounds have the potential to treat a wide variety of diseases including prostate cancer. In particular, these compounds are aimed at helping individuals who have developed a resistance to androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT). While most ADT therapeutics utilize androgen receptor (AR) antagonists or androgen synthesis inhibitors, this technology utilizes specific compounds that work to reduce AR expression, which could potentially help ADT-resistant patients by decreasing overall resistance to begin with.","Long-term prostate cancer control is currently done through the use of ADT. Unfortunately, ADT can ultimately lead to resistance to this therapy, which quickly progresses in to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There are no solutions for individuals who develop a resistance to ADT, and with no solutions, individuals struggle with the ability to maintain the treatment of their cancer. The technology proposed here provides a solution to current ADT-resistant patients and ultimately allows prostate cancer patients to maintain long term cancer treatment.",Healthcare Portfolios

Fast Gamma-Ray Interaction-Position Estimation,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed systems and methods for estimating gamma ray positions that are faster, more accurate, and more computationally and memory-use efficient than known systems and methods used in the medical imaging field.","Scintillator-based detectors have been extensively used in both clinical and pre-clinical SPECT and PET scanners, due to their relatively low cost, high gamma-ray stopping power and fast timing. Position-estimation algorithms or decoding methods are applied for gamma-ray interaction position localization with signals induced by scintillation photons on light sensors (PMTs, SiPMs, etc.). Many gamma-ray position estimation/decoding algorithms based on reference datasets have been proposed because they provide better positioning capability for gamma-ray interactions especially at detector edges and corners, and also filter out events that Compton scatter and deposit energy in multiple positions in the detector. But reference-data-based methods need detector calibration to acquire their reference datasets, and the position estimation speed remains relatively slow due to the excessive computations required.

"Thermally Curable Silsesquioxanes for Direct Write, Laser Inscription of Optics or 3D Printing",This invention is a thermally curable silsesquioxane based resin used for direct write creation of optics and 3D additive manufacturing. The resin is cured through the inclusion of a ketone and tertiary amine that react with the light from a laser. This leads to crosslinking which aids the gelation and vitrification before the viscous liquid can spread.,"Direct writing for optics and 3D additive printing offers a more precise and efficient method of manufacturing small scale optoelectronic and dental systems. The present invention is a cost effective and simple solution for 3D additive manufacturing, specifically stereolithographic (SLA), ultra violet nano-imprint lithographic (UV-NIL), and step-and-flash imprint lithography (SFIL) 3D printing.

Additive Manufacturing Using Laser Reactive Sintering of Mixtures of Metallic Powders and Sulfur,"This invention is a new powder mixture of chalcophilic metals or others and sulfur for use in selective laser sintering (SLS), a form of 3D printing.","Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a 3D printing technology has typically been used with plastics such as nylon and polystyrene but can also be used with metals such as steel and titanium. By using 3D printing we can use these materials to create ever more complex structures that can't be made through traditional methods. However in selective laser sintering, compounds don't completely melt and fuse together. Instead, the particles in the powder will bond on the surface, not always forming a strong enough structure for the given application. There are other options like selective laser melting, which uses higher temperatures than sintering or pieces can be run through a furnace to melt the material together. Both of these processes add to the costs and complexity of a making objects with a 3D printer. The technology presented here provides a better substrate mixture that, when heated, will undergo an exothermic reaction and will get hotter than just using a laser allowing the metals to melt more evenly and form a stronger connection.",Materials
Cathodic Protection of Metal Surface Inside Pipe Filled with Molten Salt,"This invention provides an electrochemical method for detecting and arresting corrosion at the metal-molten salt interface, a location that, until now, was difficult to treat. While many of the pipes used in transfer of molten salt are resistant to corrosion on the exterior, this technology is the first to treat the interior of the pipe. Its novel design prevents corrosion in the presence of oxidizing impurities, like oxygen and water, which occur when air leaks into the system.","The concentrated solar power (CSP) industry is a variant of traditional renewable solar energy that, with use of molten salt, has the potential to provide power both day and night. Panels of computer controlled reflected lenses focus solar energy to a central power tower where a heat-transfer fluid absorbs the energy for use in traditional steam generators below. Molten salt, with its fluid like properties and high-temperature range, is an ideal heat transfer fluid. This heated salt can be stored for power generation during night-time hours, eliminating the need for battery storage. While molten salt opens the door to new, cheaper energy, it does cause metal pope corrosion if air leaks into the system. This corrosion can cut into CSP plant costs and reduce efficiency and reliability.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Modification of Valve Replacements to Reduce Calcification,"This invention is a modification of a replacement heart valve used for treating heart valve disease. The valve is modified with enzymes that generate adenosine, a known regulator of calcification. These tissue based heart valves will allow for the localized reduction of calcification, which will lead to a longer life span of the heart valve.","Annually, over five million people in the United States alone are diagnosed with heart valve disease (HVD), a condition where one of the four valves of the heart is not functioning properly. HVD is treated through surgery that either repairs or replaces the valve with a tissue or mechanical valve. Mechanical valves last much longer life than tissue valves but also require anti-coagulants for the remainder of the person’s life. Tissue valves only last 10-20 years, largely due to valve calcification. Valve calcification can occur due to aging, causing valve leaflets to become rigid and misshapen. While anti-calcification treatments are given with tissue valves, calcification can still occur and once it does, requires surgery to replace the valve. There is great interest in reducing calcification and preventing heart valve issues. Current management methods revolve around inhibiting the factors that promote calcification. There is a need to develop a solution that directly inhibits calcification for better outcomes.",Healthcare Portfolios
Leukocyte RNA Expression: A Novel Neurosurgical Genomics Technique for Predicting Seizure-Free Outcome following Stereotactic Laser Amygdalohippocampotomy,This technology provides a novel set of gene-based biomarkers to predict seizure free results in Stereotactic Laser Amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH) for epileptic patients. These biomarkers are based on leukocyte RNA expression so the prognosis can be easily done by a blood draw instead of a brain biopsy.,"Drug resistant epilepsy patients are unable to live a standard quality of life as seizures are untreatable with drugs. Candidates for surgery are patients who fail adequate trials of at least two first line medicines and one combination of at least two drugs. SLAH provides a less invasive procedure with favorable seizure-free or seizure reduction for drug resistant epilepsy patients. Approximately 2/3 of patients that go through craniotomy involving procedures, such as Amygdalohippocampotomy (AH), obtain seizure free status. Meanwhile an approximate 77% of patients that go through SLAH obtain significant seizure reductions (54% obtaining seizure free status). Due to the high numbers of patients that may be unresponsive to surgical interventions, it is critical to implement a prediction analysis technology to reduce expenses to both patients and healthcare providers that result from unnecessary treatment. Furthermore, patients can avoid serious consequences like verbal and visual memory loss from performing a surgery they wouldn't respond to.",Healthcare Portfolios

A Cut and Paste Method for Modification of cMyBP-C in Muscle Sarcomeres,"This technology utilizes unique “spy” proteins, allowing researchers to effectively “cut and paste” desired cMyBP-C sequences that could include a variety of modifications such as point mutations and FRET probes. This method makes the manipulation of cMyBP-C in thick filaments a lot easier.","cMyBP-C is an essential regulator of heart muscle contraction. Mutations in the gene that encodes cMyBP-C are a leading cause of abnormal thickening of the heart muscle known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). cMyBP-C has an abundance of dynamic interactions that occur with binding partners in the sarcomere, making the study of this protein extremely complex. Furthermore, manipulation of large, thick filaments such as myosin, titin, and cMyBP-C within muscle cells is very difficult. It is widely recognized that this obstacle is the single most important barrier to progress in cMyBP-C research. This technology uses a new approach to potentially overcome this barrier and improve cMyBP-C research.",Research Tools
Percutaneous Vascular Anastomosis: a Device for Creating a Minimally Invasive Vascular Access,"This device consists of an expandable tubular graft that when unsheathed completely creates a branch anastomosis. The device is image guided, minimally invasive, does not require fine suturing, and requires a significantly lower level of procedural training.","Hemodialysis replicates kidney functions for those with renal failure, filtering waste out of blood. Blood is taken out, treated, and replaced. Dialysis may occur three times a week with three to four hour long sessions. The traditional methods to get access to the blood involve surgery in the arm or leg through which a vein is artificially connected to an existing artery. The heart pumps blood out through arteries and blood returns through veins. Dialysis involves a high flowrate through an artificial entry, and a fistula or graft allow the vein to better accommodate this change. However, that risks infection and fails 60% of the time. A simple percutaneously created anastomosis device is needed. Such a device would obviate the need for an open surgical procedure replacing it with a closed, sutureless, through-the-skin approach serving as the foundation for alternative forms of dialysis to be developed. Such a device would be disruptive to current methods and would significantly reduce the morbidity, mortality, expense and availability of chronic dialysis.",Healthcare Portfolios

It handles large data sets with speed, accuracy and efficiency.","Most bioinformatics methods need a reference source of known genomes to ensure accurate measurements of depth and variance. Sequencing and comparing wholly unknown genomes with no reference (all-vs-all) can be unwieldy both in terms of computation and storage, making microbes in complicated samples hard to identify. Libra is constructed on a big data framework, which makes it tailored to scale up for large sequences and efficiently store them.",Healthcare Portfolios
Rotationally Shift Invariant And Multi-Layered Microlens Array,"This invention describes a nontraditional use of the Gabor Superlens and is a configuration of multiple microlens array structures. The rotationally shift invariant and multiple microlens array system provides full-field of view imaging wherein all of the incoming light (i.e., light from all directions), in a solid angle of 4pi steradians, is focused inside the optics.","LiDAR and other sensing technologies have need for the collection of light reflected from a scene in full 4Pi steradians with one optical system, but achieving such systems has remained challenging. It has traditionally been considered impossible because it was believed that detectors must be placed outside the optics, blocking the incoming light. Therefore, there is a need for an optical design wherein the detectors are positioned to provide full-field of view imaging and/or photo collection without blocking any of the incoming light.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Implementing Multiplication And Division In Optics,This invention is an all-optical approach to implementing mathematical operations on a circuit board in a computer. It uses the non-linear response to light of certain types of thin film materials in a novel approach to multiply &amp; divide numbers in an all-optical mathematical circuit. The approach is an analogue method which implies a constant time for mathematical operation and will not increase as the problem size increases in scale,One of the major challenges in electronic computation is the optimization problem occurring in a large data set where each variable depends on or has influence on other variables. Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are tools that are used to compute probability distributions over large and complex interacting variables.  Electronic central processing units (CPUs) are not the best tools to address these problems because of  heat generation and bandwidth limitations of electronic devices as they get smaller and faster.,Imaging & Optics
Chemiluminescence Imaging of Oxidative Stress in Vivo,"This patented invention is a new probe to be utilized for chemiluminescent imaging. This probe allows for in vivo whole animal imaging and has currently been tested in mice. The probe itself is sluggish in a natural biological system but is catalyzed in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a commonly used molecule often utilized in the production of antibody conjugates. This probe has been found not to be metabolized within a mouse model and is cleared from the body within eight hours, making it a suitable and safe probe for biological systems. The use of this probe could potentially allow for the molecular imaging of a diverse set of biological processes by tagging a targeting ligand with HRP. Therefore, the probe will only be catalyzed and activated where the ligand is bound. Currently, it has been shown to properly label inflammation in a mouse model through the addition of an HRP-antibody conjugate for IgG. This invention has the potential to be utilized at both a research and diagnostic level.","Chemiluminescence imaging has been utilized for many years for bio-assays and in vitro imaging. It is widely preferred over fluorescent imaging because it does not require outside excitation to produce luminescence. This reduces background noise and results in quantifiable and precise luminescence. The drawbacks of chemiluminescence involve the lack of a suitable biological probe as well as the ability to signal specific biological events. Currently, chemiluminescent probes are utilized in vitro and are activated only by oxidation in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While ROS levels are indicative of many disease states, current probes are not designed to tell these disease states apart or to be utilized within a living system.",Life Sciences
"Vulcanization for tire rubber production with lower temperatures, more efficient crosslinking, and improved properties","Methods of vulcanization using a high sulfur content polymer, instead of elemental sulfur, have been developed for tire rubber production. The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking. Furthermore, this technology suppresses ""reversion,"" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.","Vulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency,  vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.",Materials
Mosquito Birth Control,"This technology is a new method to control mosquito populations by disrupting mosquito-specific proteins important for embryonic development. Based on a bioinformatics study, a mosquito-specific Eggshell Organizing Factor 1 (EOF1) was discovered, which is not highly conserved in other species. Experiments on mosquitos demonstrated that disrupting the biology of this eggshell formation pathway in the female mosquito after a blood meal results in non-viable eggs.","Approximately 80% of the global population is threatened by vector-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, West Nile Virus, zika virus and various encephalitis diseases. Increasing insecticide resistance exacerbates this problem, and insecticides may also harm non-target populations. The transmission of mosquito-borne diseases has become so problematic that both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization have made mosquito vector control a central feature of their organizational goals. Mosquitocides with new modes of action that are not also harmful to other species are needed. In addition, the Aedes aegypti mosquito breed have drought-tolerant eggshells, making them difficult to eliminate.",Life Sciences

Processor Design Tool,"This technology provides a computational approach that effectuates fully automated Network-on-Chip (NOC) design and optimization that is also applicable to processor design. The approach explores the network configuration space to determine, e.g., optimal network latencies, power consumption, and the underlying link/interconnect allocations for any given number of routers, i.e., the ab initio network-on-chip design.","Multi-core processors have enabled ongoing computer performance improvement (i.e., trying to keep Moore’s law alive) but at the cost of increasing complexity of network design. Most network design is optimized for bandwidth but, for any given bandwidth design, there is a need to address tradeoffs between parameters, such as, but not limited to, latency and power, the latter also being responsible for heat generation. Using a Pareto-optimal design framework, this technology automatically generates ab initio network designs that optimize those tradeoffs according to user specifications or requirements. As such, it is a critical capability that directly supports the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.",Software & Information Technology
Smallsat SSA Station,"This technology is a methodology for using multi-static, long baseline interferometry imaging radar with balloon CubeSat satellites for the tracking, imaging, and classification of space objects, particularly objects that are in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO).","Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957, mankind has progressively added more satellites, and consequently more debris, into Earth's orbit. As of 2013, NASA has tracked over 500,000 pieces of debris larger than the size of an average marble, and this number is constantly increasing. The amount of satellites and debris have posed a problem with the ability to track and image objects, especially those that are small. Traditional techniques for tracking these satellites are not sufficient enough to provide high-resolution images and small objects are often missed.

Use of Catalyzed Hydrogen Peroxide (CHP) Chemical System for Stripping of Implanted State-of-the-Art UV Resists,"This invention addresses the use of Catalyzed Hydrogen Peroxide (CHP) chemical systems at low temperatures, less than 80°C, for disrupting crust formed on deep UV resist layers so that the underlying resist layer can be removed easily. Systematic investigation of variables such as hydrogen peroxide and catalyst concentration and time has led to the development of an optimal formulation for attacking the crust. It has been found that effective removal of high dose implanted PR is possible by first exposing the resist to CHP solution at room temperature followed by immersion in 2:1 sulfuric acid-peroxide mixture (SPM) at 80°C.","Photoresist is typically employed as block mask during ion implantation for front-end-off-line (FEOL) CMOS device processing. Removal of resists exposed to ions during this processing is currently carried out by an oxygen plasma ash method followed by a wet stripping process. Dry stripping methods using oxygen plasma cause particulate contamination and silicon loss and need a follow up wet cleaning step. All wet cleaning methods based on high temperature sulfuric acid-peroxide mixtures (SPM) appear to overcome some of the limitations of dry stripping but still are not very effective in removing carbonized crusts formed by implanted resists at dosages greater than 1016/cm2. Further, high temperature and extreme low pH conditions used in SPM based resist stripping pose a serious safety concern. Eliminating the ash and reducing the temperature of the wet chemical strips will reduce the energy footprint of the strip and simultaneously reduce the number of process steps.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

Rotationally Shift Invariant Optical System,Researchers at the University of Arizona have designed a highly sophisticated LiDAR system that uses a novel optical phased array transmitter in conjunction with a novel spherically shift-invariant (SSI) receiver system to provide depth information over a large 2D scene in a single snapshot. The field of view of the receiver is increased by the novel optical design to properly focus incoming light from a large set of angles. The system also improves the depth resolution and reduces position ambiguity.,"Optical phased arrays have been used for increasing the speed and field of view of LiDAR systems, but the element to element spacing is too large, leading to reduced range and target position ambiguity.  For some applications, SSI systems can increase the field of view, but at large angles, the focal point quickly moves away from the centerline.",Imaging & Optics
"PVAD: a Linear, Pulsatile, Peristaltic Ventricular Assist Device Mechanism","This invention is a modified linear peristaltic pump. This pumps utilizes a pulsatile mechanism, other than a traditional rotary pump that is often used in ventricular assist devices, to pump the blood, which help decrease blood clots.","Ventricular Assistant Devices (VADs) help consistently pump from the lower chambers of the heart to the rest of the body. A number of pumps offer various benefits, but this linear peristaltic pump presents unique value. A peristaltic pump propels fluid, in this case blood, by a process that most closely mimics biological systems and allows for precise control. In addition, peristaltic pumps utilize a closed system, minimizing contamination and reducing maintenance needs through the simpler design. One of the major risks of an VAD is the chance of blood clotting. To help prevent blood clots, blood thinners are proactively prescribed to patients once a VAD has been implanted. Blood thinners also come with their own set of risks and often times require routine lab work to monitor effects. This invention uses a linear version of the peristaltic pump containing a new mechanism that is used to create a milking action for advancing the blood. This device has the potential to decrease the amount of blood clots that are seen with the use of standard VADs.",Healthcare Portfolios
Improved Inferior Vena Cava Filter,This technology is an improved inferior vena cava (IVC) filter that allows for adjustments during deployment to prevent tilting of the filter within the inferior vena cava.,"An IVC filter is used to prevent pulmonary embolism in patients who have built up thrombosis. However, a large percentage of IVC filters cannot be retrieved at a later point due to tilting, which can result in the IVC filter becoming buried in the blood vessel wall. Tilting often occurs due to improper deployment during placement of the IVC. Once the IVC hook becomes embedded in the vessel wall it cannot be removed. Therefore, there is a need for an improved retrievable IVC filter that will prevent tilting.",Healthcare Portfolios

Transgenic Resistance to Cotton Leaf Curl Disease in Cotton,"This invention utilizes RNA interference techniques to produce a transgenic cotton strain that is resistant to cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD). These transgenic cotton plants do not produce the characteristic curling of the leaves and do not accumulate the virus. Furthermore, it produces resistance against multiple forms of the virus. This invention has the potential to protect cotton crops from one of the most devastating diseases they encounter.","As the most used fiber in the world, cotton is grown in sixty countries that produce over 100 million new bales annually. The most devastating disease to cotton is cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD), which is caused by several begomoviral species transmitted through an insect known as the Whitefly. The disease is distinguished by the thickening of the leaf veins, causing a curl in the leaf. This virus greatly affects the cotton crop yield as well as the quality of the cotton that is produced. Historically, Pakistan has experienced the largest impact of CLCuD, where the disease has previously reduced cotton yields by over 30%, a $5 billion loss. The disease has recently spread and is now affecting cotton crops in China and the Philippines as well. Without a proper cure or preventative measures, CLCuD has the potential to result in further cotton production loss.",Agriculture & Horticulture

Custom Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy for Antigen Attack of Cancer Cells,"This technology is a new method to develop patient-specific CAR T-cells for conditions characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of T-cells, such as T-cell lymphoma. This approach directs CAR-T cells only to T cells of a given clonal type. There are millions of T cell clones in each patient, each bearing a unique T cell receptor. Here, the inherent specificity of T cells is used to target only malignant T cells clones, resulting in little or no off-target binding and virtually no on-target off-tumor binding. Since typically all the malignant cells in an individual patient with T cell leukemia/lymphoma derive from just one clone, a CAR-T approach directed against this one clone has exquisite specificity, in principle much more specificity than any other CAR-T approach now available or in the pipeline.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy provides a promising way of treating cancer, especially in patients with blood-related cancers. It has been a challenge in the T cell setting to identify an appropriate cell-surface target like the CD19-B cell target. More importantly, ablation of a patient's T cell population via CAR-T therapy may not be manageable the way that B cell ablation is (via use of immunoglobulins). And, for any CAR-T approach, off target binding and on-target off-tumor binding that contributes to cytokine release syndrome is a big concern.

Genetically Engineered Smart Biopolymer to Combat a Broad Range of Microbial Infections,"This technology is a platform to develop stable protein polymers that have attached antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This platform involves a novel approach to structurally modify, synthesize and minimize the cost of AMP polymers, specifically for use within clinical settings.","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are more efficient at killing antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) microorganisms than antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal drugs. However, AMPs are quickly degraded in the bloodstream and require high dosages, which can have adverse side effects, limiting their uses in a clinical setting. To reduce degradation and the need for higher dosages, AMPs are being attached to polymers to produce AMP incorporated biomaterials such as nanoparticles, membranes and films. Unfortunately, the production of AMP polymers requires complex chemical synthesis methods, resulting in inconsistent AMPs and poor clinical efficacy. This invention addresses the current inadequacies through simplified synthetic methods with the capability to structurally modify the peptides and tethers the peptides to a polymer. This process preserves the peptides biological activity and prolongs the life of the peptides in order to make AMP therapies and treatments clinically accessible.",Materials

Enhanced Water Splitting with Protic Buffer/Electrolyte Cocatalysts,"This invention is a protic co-catalyst used to increase the rate of electrolysis for splitting water to hydrogen and oxygen in a hydrogen evolving reaction. The co-catalyst is present in the electrolyte and is not consumed during the reaction. The co-catalyst may enhance the efficiency of water-splitting in systems that use a heterogenous catalyst, such as platinum, or a homogenous catalyst, such as water-soluble hydrogenase. The co-catalyst may significantly reduce the overpotential energy requirement and/or may increase the current density of the electrochemical system. This invention may be broadly applicable to various water-splitting system designs and may improve the efficiency of hydrogen production from solar energy conversion systems.","There is a tremendous world-wide interest in developing clean and abundant energy sources as alternatives to fossil fuels to satisfy the rapidly growing need for energy. Development of solar voltaic cells to convert solar energy into electrical energy is very promising. However, solar energy production is intermittent and the electrical energy generated therefrom, while useful, must be used immediately or it is lost. One promising way to store this energy is in the form of chemical bonds. Particularly promising is to warehouse this energy in the strong chemical bond in molecular hydrogen. The development of the “H2 economy,” which is a proposed system based on the production, storage, and utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier, has generated considerable interest. Unfortunately, H2 production by the electrolytic splitting of water using current technologies does not have the efficiency to compete with steam reforming of natural gas or other fossil fuel sources, largely because of the current relative costs for electricity from the grid. Thus, there remains a need for technologies with improved and efficient performance for generating hydrogen from water splitting.",Sensors & Controls

Novel Diazeniumdiolate-Based Aspirin Prodrugs for Cancer Treatment,"A compound has been developed for releasing controlled fluxes of HNO in physiological media or conditions. The compound undergoes a slow hydrolysis at physiological pH, such that it generates a correspondingly lower steady-state concentration of HNO, minimizing its dimerization/dehydration to N2O. As a result the compound can provide increased efficacy against pain, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. The invention is the formulation of a diazeniumdiolate, a NO donor prodrug. The invention expands on this drug prototype by covalently attaching non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), specifically aspirin, to nitrate esters. NSAIDs are used for treatment of pain and inflammation. The ester linkage of a diazeniumdiolate is designed to reduce NSAID toxicity by increasing stability and absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract. The linkage also allows localized delivery of NO. An advantage of diazeniumdiolates is the ability to manage the amount of NO donation by manipulating the rate of decomposition. The compound is designed to be a well-tolerated agent able to damage DNA and induce cell death of cancer cells with little toxicity in normal cells.","Nitroxyl (HNO) is an elusive chemical species that has been shown to possess intriguing biological properties.

Calibration Method for Photon Counting Detectors,"This technology is a calibration method that could be a game changer for adoption of photon counting-based imagery. It solves long-standing challenges in the calibration of detectors used in medical imaging devices and is also useful for security screenings and other imaging photon counting detectors. The method is simple to use, requires less time than conventional calibration methods, and is easy to implement, while also pushing the current state of the art into additional applications.","The calibration process for photon counting-based imagery has been a hindrance to its broader adoption. The relative signal strengths of the light sensors within the photon counting detectors are used to estimate the position and energy attributes of each gamma-ray interaction. Several methods consisting of simple linear combinations of signals are conventionally used to estimate gamma-ray interaction position for monolithic crystal gamma-ray detectors. In order to apply these methods, detector calibration is necessary to determine the detector sensors response as a function of gamma-ray interaction position. However, each of these methods has significant disadvantages, such as being very time consuming or being unable to calibrate depth of interaction information. Accordingly, what is needed is an improved method for calibrating gamma-ray and photon counting detectors.",Imaging & Optics

Production of HNO from Derivatized Diazeniumdiolates,"A compound has been developed for releasing controlled fluxes of HNO in physiological media or conditions by researchers at the University of Arizona. The compound undergoes a slow hydrolysis at physiological pH, such that it generates a correspondingly lower steady-state concentration of HNO, minimizing its dimerization/dehydration to N2O. As a result the compound can provide increased efficacy against pain, cancer, or cardiovascular disease.","Nitroxyl (HNO) is an elusive chemical species that has been shown to possess intriguing biological properties. For example, nitroxyl has been implicated in the mechanism of cyanamide's inhibitory effect on aldehyde dehydrogenase in treating alcohol abuse as well as reversing experimental heart failure.  Despite HNO having been described in the chemical literature for decades, there are surprising gaps in the literature that complicate the rational exploitation of its pharmacological properties. Historically, Angeli's salt (AS) has been known to generate HNO in solution. Recently, IPA/NO (1, the sodium salt of diazeniumdiolated isopropylamine) has been shown to mimic AS in its chemical and biological properties. Unfortunately, neither of these salts are suitable from the drug development perspective since both are difficult to purify.",Materials
A GI-Specific Contrast Agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"A scaffold bearing eight terminal alkyne groups was synthesized from sucrose, and copies of an azide-terminated Gd-DOTA complex were attached via copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition in this invention. This contrast agent (CA) was administered by gavage to C3H mice. Passage of the CA through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was followed by T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a period of 48 hours. Thus, a new, orally administered, GI-specific CA for MRI has been developed and successfully demonstrated.","Gastrointestinal (GI) radiography using barium contrast media has been widely used as a first-choice diagnostic imaging modality for detection of GI pathologies. Colonoscopy is the standard of care for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. However, colonoscopy is an invasive procedure that requires intravenous sedation and suffers from patient noncompliance. CT colonography (CT-C) has high sensitivity to identify large polyps, but sensitivity decreases with polyp size and radiation dosage is a concern. MRI colonography (MR-C) uses non-ionizing radiation and provides CRC lesion detection with high specificity, yet modest sensitivity. MR-C has been indicated in cases of incomplete colonoscopy, due to obstruction, and is increasingly being applied as a non-invasive screening tool without the need for sedation.",Healthcare Portfolios

Veress Needle Interface for Tension Pneumothorax Decompression,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have designed an interface for the modified Veress needle (mVN) to address the shortcomings of older devices used to treat tension pneumothorax such as traditional Needle Thoracostomy (NT). This interface serves as an attachment that adds additional functionality to the standard Veress needle. Equipped with a manual unlock and automatic locking mechanism, this enhancement is durable and includes both a one-way valve to prevent backflow and a flow indicator to monitor whether the device is working properly. In addition, it is compatible with standard Veress needle syringe assemblies and medical kits. Ultimately, it increases ease in using modified Veress needles, which are proven safer and more effective in tension pneumothorax decompression procedures.","In 2013, the article “Modified Veress needle decompression of tension pneumothorax: a randomized crossover animal study,” authored in part by the inventors, was published and thus established the superiority of modified Veress needles over NT for treatment of tension pneumothorax in animals. Standard NTs were found to have inadequate length, small bore diameter, lack of tactile and visual feedback, and low durability relative to the inventors’ mVNs. This interface adds further improvements to the device since the 2013 publication, including identification of optimal needle length and diameter, spring strength, and creation of an airflow indicator.",Healthcare Portfolios

A Biomarker Platform for Parkinson's Disease,This invention is a biomarker platform for Parkinson's disease (PD). It combines several parameters on a patient's dermal fibroblasts to diagnose and monitor the progression of PD. The parameters can potentially be correlated with specific clinical PD phenotypes and severity.,"Approximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease each year, contributing to the 10 million worldwide. Currently, PD is diagnosed at a relatively late stage when the disease has already advanced significantly. Making an accurate diagnosis of PD is difficult as there are no standard diagnostic tests. Most diagnoses are based on physician's observation and experience. The current best industry practice involves scanning the brain to measure dopamine and brain metabolism. Unfortunately, these tests are extremely expensive and are limited to specialized imaging centers. Hence, there is a critical need to develop reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. This invention fills the unmet need by potentially providing a set of standard tests for PD diagnosis and prognosis.",Healthcare Portfolios

Ionic Plastic Filled Nanowire Ultra Capacitor,"The unique feature of this invention is the manufacturing process, which uses commercially available or customized dielectric membrane templates with nano-pores to increase the surface area of the conducting materials allowing for more capacitance per unit area than a parallel plate capacitor could ever hope to achieve. This process will most likely impact integrated circuits and portable electronics, but due to its small size and unique features it may find its way into new applications not conceived of today.  Digitated capacitors have been fabricated using commercial filters such as polycarbonate and aluminum oxide membranes. 10µm, 20µm, and 60µm thick membranes were explored with pore diameter ranging from 15nm to 1µm and density of 106 to 1010 pores/cm2. Nanopores on the membranes were filled by electrodeposition with copper to form the digitated nano structure. The digitated device fabricated to date showed 10-100mF/cm3 or 1-10mF/gram of capacitance density which is much superior to the commercial parallel plate capacitors. Conducting polymer can also be deposited in nanopores resulting in storing more charges with less weight thus yielding a further increase in capacitance density. We also have technology for building custom templates, which is useful in fabrication of devices with special features. A capacitor of 4F can be built using a 20cm2 barium titanate template of 100µm thickness. Connecting nano structured capacitors in parallel will lead to capacitor packs with significant storage capacity (hundreds of Farads) for high-energy consuming applications from portable devices to pulse power demanding vehicles. We have developed technology for building interdigitated devices with even greater storage capabilities.","This invention proposes a unique, relatively simple, and controllable manufacturing process that yields a compact 3D structure with a very high capacitance to volume ratio- more than 10,000 times larger than a conventional parallel plate capacitor. This development makes way for a device with large capacitance, but very small size that will help catalyze the miniaturization of electronics.",Engineering & Physical Sciences

The distance between the source and the object can be calculated by measuring the delay and/or phase shift of the reflected light. Two common ToF methods are direct pulse modulation and continuous wave modulation. For direct pulse modulation, the intensity of the source is modulated, and the delay of the reflected pulse, τ, is measured. For continuous wave modulation, the source amplitude is modulated periodically and the phase difference between the source and reflected light is measured. However, neither of these methods produce a high-speed and high-resolution measurement.",Imaging & Optics

Glycoconjugates of Antiproliferative Iron Pro-Chelators Targeting Cancer Cell Metabolism,This technology provides novel glycoconjugates of antiproliferative iron pro-chelators that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells.,"Cancer cells require higher iron levels in order to sustain fast proliferation rates, and have high glucose demands to sustain growth. This vulnerability of malignant behavior can be targeted by the use of small-molecule chelators that interfere with the availability of intracellular iron. Because the ability to decrease iron levels offers an opportunity to slow or halt tumor growth, iron chelation is emerging as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic avenue. The key to success of chelation therapy in cancer treatment, however, is the capacity to target iron in malignant cells selectively over normal tissues and iron in the extracellular space. Lacking such selectivity, currently available iron chelators have elicited adverse side effects when employed in cancer research, and none of the iron chelators used for iron overload blood disorders have received approval for a cancer indication to date.",Healthcare Portfolios

New Metallopolymers for Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen,"This invention is a new, less expensive, and more efficient process for producing hydrogen gas using photoactive metallopolymers with the potential to be incorporated into fuel cells. This invention combines solar cell technology with hydrogen catalysts to photochemically generate hydrogen, rather than electrochemically, with the ability to form into a solid film.","Hydrogen (H2) has the potential for use as a clean alternative energy source, and is generally produced by either reforming hydrocarbons or electrolysis of water. Artificial photosynthetic technology makes use of biomimetic analogues of an active site on an existing biological enzyme, which converts proton sources (such as water) into hydrogen, and existing methods must be performed in solution. This new process makes use of photoactive organic/inorganic hybrid polymers called metallopolymers, which are commonly used for converting light into electricity, but in this case are combined with biomimetic analogues to convert light into hydrogen gas.

Toll-like Receptor 2 Ligands and Methods of Making and Using Thereof,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed a set of 13 high-affinity toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists. In certain diseases, particularly pancreatic cancer, these receptors are overexpressed. TLR2 agonists are absorbed by these receptors. When the ligands are labeled with fluorescent proteins, the tumors can be identified. Additionally, these ligands can be combined with therapeutic agents to allow them to be absorbed specifically by cancerous tissue.","Pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate lower than 6%.

Traverse and Trajectory Optimization and Multi-Purpose Tracking,"This invention is a multivariate optimization framework using stochastic optimization algorithms for planning applications. These algorithms perform model inversions and work with 3D data. This framework provides planning solutions for a variety of applications including surgical procedures, logistics, and transportation.","When computational models and simulations are run, various inputs are given to the system. The system then returns the model’s predicted outcome. While these models can be refined to give very accurate predictions, it can be a challenge to run these models in reverse, or invert them. To invert a model today, a user would typically need to manually try various inputs and verify if the desired outcome is still achieved. Ideally, a user would only need to enter a desired outcome, and have the system give back the inputs that would be required to achieve this outcome.

Running a model backwards can have significant benefits. If there is a specific outcome desired, an inversion of the model can produce the optimal inputs required. For example, if a vehicle needs to reach a specific destination, the optimal path of least resistance can be calculated. While algorithms exist to solve these types of problems in 2D space, such as Dijkstra, traveling salesman problem, and A*, there are relatively few that can solve 3D problems, encompassing terrain types and altitudes.",Software & Information Technology

Application of Neuroprotective Beta Amyloid Core Peptides and Peptidomimetic Derivatives to the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease,"Despite a notable role for amyloid and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, treatments aimed at lowering the levels of beta amyloid or disrupting amyloid plaques have had little or no impact on the disease. Using a novel approach, a core hexapeptide fragment derived from beta amyloid has been shown to be protective at the synaptic, cellular and behavioral levels against beta amyloid toxicity and is being used in this invention as a platform for deriving stabilized versions and peptidomimetics for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The hexapeptide core beta amyloid fragment is non-toxic, potent as a neuroprotective agent in the pM to nM range, and likely functions by competing against beta amyloid either directly at the receptor(s) level and/or indirectly via intracellular signaling.","Alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death and currently costs over $250 billion in health care in the US. By 2050, it is projected that the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease in the US will nearly triple to nearly 14 million. To date, there is no cure for the disease, or treatment to slow down its progress. The underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease is well understood, involving beta amyloid forming dense plaques and abnormal tau protein disrupting nerve cell morphology and function, but attempts to reduce the pathology have not had an impact on the disease. Nonetheless, substantial evidence exists implicating elevated levels of soluble (diffusible) beta amyloid in neuronal toxicity, in conjunction with induction of abnormal tau, during the course of the disease. This invention is directed at blocking and/or reversing the effects of high levels of beta amyloid via the action of novel neuroprotective agents derived from beta amyloid itself.",Life Sciences

These off-set pools of amplicons are used to reconstruct whole and near-whole genomic sequences in samples otherwise deemed non-useful.","When performing conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for genomic sequencing, some poor-quality biological samples are deemed ""negative"" or unusable. However, this result may be caused by RNA/DNA fragments which are simply too short and fragmented, or too unique, for conventional methods to identify. This material may currently be relegated to non-analysis. This invention enables analysis of samples comprising low concentrations or degraded nucleic acid, samples with sought-after rare mutations, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), or generally, any poor-quality samples where conventional PCR methods have failed.",Life Sciences

IL-18 as a Cardiac Biomarker in Sickle Cell Anemia,"This invention is the use of IL-18 and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with it as diagnostic and prognostic markers for myocardial fibrosis, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with sickle cell disease. IL-18 is also a potential therapeutic target for preventing sudden death in sickle cell disease patients.","Cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death are the top causes of premature death in sickle cell disease patients. These factors contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients in their 40s over the past two decades. The inventor has found that IL-18 level and its associated SNPs can predict prolonged QTc, a known risk factor for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death in sickle cell disease. Anti-IL-18 therapy reduces ventricular arrythmia in SCD animal models.

Powdered G-protein Coupled Receptors,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have generated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) lypophilized (freeze-dried) into powdered form. When thawed and rehydrated, these GPCRs retain the functionality of their pre-frozen state even after one year. Because this process also involves the removal of water, the inventors were able to produce thawed GPCRs with specific hydration levels. This appears to be a useful preservation method for GPCRs as well as a way to generate GPCRs with specific concentrations of water (or, as the inventors demonstrated, deuterium) for research purposes.","This protocol was written as part of an experiment conducted to elucidate the manner by which rhodopsin (a kind of GPCR) mobility is regulated by retinal cofactor of rhodopsin. The nature of the experiment required the substitution of protons with deuterons.

Following the conduction of greenhouse trials, several strains of native bunchgrasses were evaluated for quality and density. While the particulars for each class of grass varies, plant clones were generally subjected to culling processes based on metrics associated with turf quality in addition to survivability. Because these grasses are derived from native species, environmental impact decreases when the grasses spread beyond their intended areas, an issue that arises non-native grasses become an invasive species.",Agriculture & Horticulture

Smart Textile to Predict Diabetic Foot Ulcer,"This invention is a movable, washable smart textile that can measure abnormalities in pressure and temperature when a patient walks on it. The textile can analyze the data and send alerts to the patient when abnormalities suggest the presence of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and/or the likelihood of falls or other injuries.","Demand for new methods of detecting diabetic foot ulcers is high since the development of new treatments has stalled since the late 1990s. Currently one in four patients with diabetic ulcers will require a foot amputation. This extremely serious side effect proposes a clear need for an alternative to the current treatments: patient education, appropriate footwear, and regular care.

Expansible Ascending Aortic Graft,"This technology offers an expansible ascending aortic graft that allows for gradual expansion in systole and recoil in diastole, reducing blow flow turbulence and low-flow areas.","Patients who suffer from senile aortic valve stenosis often require aortic valve replacement. In many patients, concomitant aneurysmal disease requires the removal and replacement of the ascending aorta. Currently, the ascending aorta is often replaced with vascular grafts made of Dacron or poly-tetra-fluro-ethylene (PTFE). Despite their flexibility, these grafts have minimal compliance, leading to blood flow turbulence and low flow areas. Because the ascending aorta is responsible for roughly 50% of the impedance of the entire aorta, loss of the aortic wall expansion increases the cardiac workload.

Technology for Building Capacitors Using Templates with Nano Scale Pores,"The unique feature of this invention is the manufacturing process, which uses commercially available or customized dielectric membrane templates with nano-pores to increase the surface area of the conducting materials allowing for more capacitance per unit area than a parallel plate capacitor could ever hope to achieve. This process will most likely impact integrated circuits and portable electronics, but due to its small size and unique features it may find its way into new applications not conceived of today. Digitated capacitors have been fabricated using commercial filters such as polycarbonate and aluminum oxide membranes. 10µm, 20µm, and 60µm thick membranes were explored with pore diameter ranging from 15nm to 1µm and density of 106 to 1010 pores/cm2. Nanopores on the membranes were filled by electrodeposition with copper to form the digitated nano structure. The digitated device fabricated to date showed 10-100mF/cm3 or 1-10mF/gram of capacitance density which is much superior to the commercial parallel plate capacitors. Conducting polymer can also be deposited in nanopores resulting in storing more charges with less weight thus yielding a further increase in capacitance density. We also have technology for building custom templates, which is useful in fabrication of devices with special features. A capacitor of 4F can be built using a 20cm2 barium titanate template of 100µm thickness.

Volumetric Segmentation of Cardiac Images,"This invention is a semi-automated segmentation method and system which significantly reduces the amount of time and expertise required by an operator and also improves accuracy and repeatability. While the inventors have implemented this approach specifically for segmentation of right ventricles in 4D images, this invention is adaptable to a wide range of other medical imaging and other application areas. The user only selects a few landmarks, rather than entire contours, and then the remaining segmentation and related analytics are performed automatically. By minimizing user input and eliminating the need for training data, this new invention can reduce imaging time and, in the case of the current cardiac implementation, shift much of the workload from radiologists to technicians.","There are a number of limitations of current segmentation algorithms when dealing with complex images over time. Dynamic programming can manage some of these shortcomings but that approach creates new challenges including the need to conduct training for each segmentation analysis as well as managing errors introduced with multi-point shape intersections. Current cardiac segmentation techniques require the user to manually outline the ventricle and then use training data to mimic the movement throughout the cardiac phase. They also use shape models, which reduce accuracy and, in particular, the ability to segment pathological cases.",Healthcare Portfolios

Using Quantum-Like Behavior of Elastic-Waves for Quantum Computing Using Phi-Bits,"This technology describes a method in which phonons can be manipulated for use in encoding information, for use with quantum computing-type algorithms. Rather than qubits, this method produces φ-bits, which are achieved through operating on the phonon wave phase. Such control results from fermion-like behavior of phonons, thus allowing for utilization in numerous computing platforms.","Phonons are known to display boson characteristics in the sense that there is no restriction on the number of “particles” which can occupy the same quantum state. This invention describes the discovery of fermion-like characteristics of phonons reminiscent of constraints imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning that two “particles” cannot occupy the same quantum state. Much like in quantum computing, where qubits which can display a superposition of two states, these manipulated fermion-like phonons can display a superposition of wave propagation directions.  There are several ways of realizing fermion-like phonons such as composite elastic structures supporting rotational waves, phononic structures composed of appropriately connected mass-spring elements.  Phonons in these systems can be described by spinor wave function, resulting in a defined concept called the φ(phase)-bit. Similar to qubits, these φ-bits can be used for encoding and processing information.  This information is encoded in elastic waves which are more resilient to limiting factors such as decoherence. This allows for computation in devices at room temperature, reducing the bulk, cost, and energy necessary for current quantum computers.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Small Molecular Weight Inhibitors of the DNA - KU70/80 Association to Sensitize Cells for Radiation or Chemotherapy,This invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting cancer cell survival and/or promoting cell death following radiation or chemotherapy applied in cancer treatment. This invention can be used to treat cancer alone as well. University of Arizona investigators found compounds that may disrupt the Ku70/80 – DNA repair association. The Ku70/80 dimer protein is involved in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in human and mammalian cells. These Ku70/80-DNA association inhibitors synergistically sensitized human cancer cells to radiation treatment at sub-cytotoxic concentrations.,"Each year over 700,000 American patients with common epithelial malignancies (i.e., prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancers) are likely to receive radiation as either their sole or primary treatment in combination with other modalities to target and destroy cancer cells. For all tumors, there is a dose-response curve that indicates better control with higher doses of radiation. Radiation therapy, however, can damage normal cells as well. As a result, researchers are searching for drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy without the negative side effects of treatment. These compounds, also called radiosensitizers, makes tumor cells easier to kill when combined with radiation therapy. Since an increase in radiation dosage is limited by the tolerance level of the healthy organs, sensitizing the malignant cells by specific radiosensitizers has long been a goal of cancer research.",Life Sciences

Discovery of a Tetra Peptide with Dual Mu/Delta Opioid Receptor Agonist and Kappa Opioid Receptor Antagonist Properties for the Treatment of Chronic Pain,"This invention relates to ligands for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors, more particularly to ligands that are agonists for mu and delta opioid receptors, and in some cases ligands that are also antagonists for kappa opioid receptors.","Opioids are commonly used in the treatment of severe pain. Opioids have analgesic activity through their interaction with the opioid receptors (e.g., mu (μ) opioid receptor (MOR), delta (δ) opioid receptor (DOR), kappa (κ) opioid receptor (KOR)), mostly with MOR. However, the clinical use of opioids is limited by associated side effects such as respiratory depression, constipation, development of tolerance, and addiction. Indeed, chronic pain and subsequence chronic administration of a MOR agonist can lead to KOR activation, which results in undesirable adverse and addictive behaviors. For this reason, a KOR antagonist could be used to reduce such undesirable effects of chronic MOR activation.

A Microfluidic System for Automated Dissociation of Tissue,"This invention is an automated system with the ability to dissociate a variety of soft biological tissues, such as those found in the heart or central nervous system, into viable single cells for culture preparation and other various uses. It includes a microfluidic device made from clear, low-cost, biocompatible materials integrated with imaging and a flow control system. The invention dissociates tissue samples into single cells in a quick and reliable manner.","For decades, manual trituration using micropipettes has been the standard method by which single neurons are isolated from neural tissue. The manual trituration process requires a significant amount of dexterity and training to perform correctly and can be both time-consuming and inconsistent. Furthermore, existent mechanized tissue homogenizers are geared towards large organs, which are incapable of dissociating tissue samples with sizes on the order of 1mm or less.

Hybridoma Clones and Monoclonal Antibodies to ING4,"This invention is directed to a monoclonal antibody that recognizes human ING4 in its native form. The invention is also directed to a hybridoma cell line that produces the monoclonal antibody, and to methods of diagnosing cancer using the antibody.","ING4 is a member of the ING tumor suppressor family and has been shown to play a role in many cancer-related cellular processes, including, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, angiogenesis, contact inhibition, DNA damage response, and hypoxia. Gene deletion or reduced expression of ING4 has been reported in various cancers including glioma, breast cancer, head and neck carcinoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, colon cancer, and lung cancer, implicating a tumor suppressive role of ING4 in diverse tissue types. ING4 null mice, however, do not show increased spontaneous tumor formation, suggesting that ING4 deficiency alone may not be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis. ING4 was identified in a genetic screen for candidate tumor suppressors that could suppress loss of contact inhibition in tissue culture. Subsequently, it was shown that ING4 suppressed T47D breast cancer cell growth in soft agar and MYC-initiated mammary hyperplasia in a mouse model, providing evidence for the ING4 tumor suppressor function in breast cancer. Recently, it was reported that 16.5% of breast tumors harbored an ING4 gene deletion, suggesting a tumor suppressive role of ING4 in at least a subset of breast cancer.
 
Functionally, ING4 is characterized as a transcription regulator with a mechanism involving chromatin remodeling. ING4 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motif conserved among the ING family members and other transcription factors. ING4 binds to tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) via the PHD. In addition, ING4 co-purifies with the HBO1/JADE histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, supporting a role of ING4 in chromatin modification. As H3K4me3 and HAT are generally associated with active transcription, ING4 is known to activate gene transcription in response to DNA damage. In glioma and melanoma cancer models, ING4 repressed several NF-κB-target genes, thereby attenuating tumor angiogenesis and growth. Additionally, ING4 has been shown to represses NF-κB in breast cancer cells.
 
A need exists for anti-ING4 antibodies having unique genetic and amino acid structures, including unique binding and functional characteristics.

Millimeter-Wave Reflect-Array for Compressive Threat Detection in Security Screening Applications,"University of Arizona inventors have created a security screening technology that uses a reconfigurable millimeter-wave reflect-array with compressive sensing to detect threats including guns, knives, explosives, liquids, gels, and more.","The need to modernize and improve passenger security screening has been a topic of conversation across the aviation industry for many years. Long lines, complexity of rules, and often-invasive processes are a significant burden to people undergoing checkpoint security worldwide. There is a lack of real time, effective, compact, and low-cost security screening.",Imaging & Optics
Combined Vertical Axis Wind-Water Floating Turbines for River and Ocean Operations,This invention is vertical axis wind-water combined turbines for capturing energy from both the wind and the water current. Each turbine is connected axially to the energy capture device through a common floating platform. This invention has unique design aspects for the connection to each other and to the platform to maximize energy capture.,"Electricity generation from wind turbines is an established energy sector undergoing rapid growth in the US and worldwide. The US installed wind power capacity at the end of 2007 was 16,596 MW. This represents more than a three-fold increase in wind power capacity over a five year period, and the aggressive capacity growth is predicted to continue. The majority of the installed wind turbines are a horizontal axis design, resembling an adaption of the propeller. Although horizontal axis wind turbines are well-established, they are complex and costly to transport and install. The alternate vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) designs have had limited commercial success to date, despite the advantage that they can collect wind from all directions. The classic, lift-based VAWT design originates from the 1920's and the creator George Darrieus. The Darrieus-type VAWT uses guy cables to keep the turbine erect, which can cause wear of the bottom bearing.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Active Flow Control for Wing Performance Enhancement,"This technology is an enhanced performance version of an airplane fluidic fence using active flow controls in the wing surface. The invention is applicable to wings of all shapes including helicopter rotors, propellers, wind turbines, fans and compressor blades.","To alleviate problems at high lift conditions, some designers have added chord-wise fences on highly swept wings. They can be seen, for example, in the MiG 15. These fences serve to interrupt the span-wise flow and alleviate the tip separation problem as well as help to redirect the flow in the fore-aft direction, which increases lift. However at cruise they are unneeded and thus produce only drag, both from the point of view of added surface area (skin friction) and from the added vorticity generated at the intersection of the boundary layers of the wing and the fence, which represents an energy loss.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Plant Height Measurement System for Mobile Platforms,"A plant height instrument which incorporates RTK (real-time kinematics) quality GPS positioning to establish an exact, unchanging soil elevation reference base while in motion. The positioning data provides the compensation necessary to accurately measure plant height while driving over uneven terrain, overcoming the instability inherent in sonar sensors used with mobile platforms due to irregular terrain.","Using a sensor-based approach on a mobile platform, this method of measuring plant height allows users to observe changes in plant growth over time and provides high-quality, high-density data in or near real-time. This system provides a significant advantage over the current method of hand measurements, with comparable accuracy but with the speed of a machine which can acquire data over large areas quickly. A mobile system capable of measuring plant height in real-time could be used directly or with existing tractor electronic control systems to dispense fertilizers or plant growth regulator chemicals at different rates based on a plant’s health status. Such variable rate application of fertilizers or plant growth regulator chemicals has the potential to improve agricultural production efficiencies, increase economic returns to farmers, and reduce environmental risk.",Sensors & Controls
"Interfacial Effects Enable Droplet Actuation, Inhibition Relief, and Early Sensing of Polymerase Chain Reaction","This invention is a device and associated methods that improve quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), especially in point-of-care settings, by allowing detection of PCR amplification and quantification of initial target amount to occur at an earlier amplification cycle. Ultimately this allows for faster results, and thus faster informed medical decision-making in the point-of-care setting. This innovation is possible through the novel utilization of interfacial effects in PCR reaction droplets.","Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a method of detecting DNA amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in real time, rather than after the completion of the amplification reaction. qPCR is useful in point-of-care diagnostic diagnoses of certain diseases and conditions, however current qPCR methods (e.g. fluorescence detection) still require a relatively high number of amplification cycles to occur before detection and quantification are possible. Therefore improvements that allow for the detection of PCR and quantification of initial target amount to take place at an earlier amplification cycle, and thus at an earlier time, are advantageous because they enable healthcare providers to make faster decisions in point-of-care settings.",Life Sciences
A Practical Online Platform for Scientific Publishing,"This invention is an online submission and publishing platform for scientific articles, allowing quick categorization of articles, and using social-networking concepts to reduce the turnaround time for publication while maintaining quality in research.","The advantages of publishing scientific research online have been discussed for well over a decade. At the same time, many different platforms have been developed to bring these ideas to life. As the world of online publishing continues to grow, it is important that this ever expanding body of work is organized, searchable, and continues to be of high quality. The vast amount of work being produced by current academics has caused traditional publishing methods to become a bottleneck for research becoming available to a wider audience.
 
A major component of getting a paper published is the peer-review process. As social media becomes increasingly popular, it is expected a platform for researchers to instantly start reviewing each other’s work will emerge. The more expedited the process of publication, the sooner valuable results of research can be available to the academic community and can be applied to new situations unseen by the original authors.",Software & Information Technology
Robotic Surgery - An Optimal Motion Planning Method for Computer-Assisted Surgical Training (optMIS),"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a modern surgical technique requiring small incisions or no incisions. This technology is a system for the assessment and training of minimally invasive surgical skills (MIS). The apparatus of the invention comprises a set of physical building units, sensors and actuators to embody a variety of training tasks. The sensors gather performance data on real-time, which is processed by a microcontroller and sent to an assessment module. The assessment module classifies the levels of expertise shown by the trainees based on a unique set of performance metrics and compares quantitative and qualitative performance results of a trainee against the performance results of other trainees registered in a web-based community. The guidance module provides visual guidance to the trainee on how to perform a task in the most optimal way.","Minimally invasive surgeries are performed with an endoscope and several long, thin instruments. The drawbacks associated are large incisions, operative blood loss, post-operative pain are limited, and recovery time is shorter compared to traditional open surgery. Unfortunately, from a surgeon’s perspective, laparoscopic surgery is more challenging than conventional surgery because of the restricted vision, hand–eye coordination problems, limited working space and lack of tactile sensation. These issues make MIS a difficult skill for medical students and residents to master.",Software & Information Technology
The Infrared Retina,"This invention proposes an infrared retina that exploits the continuous spectral tunability of mid-infrared quantum-dot based sensors. The detectors sense information over different spectrally overlapping bands, similar to the cones in the human eye. The resulting spectral diversity can be exploited in an array format with either fixed spatial functionality, as is done in the retina, or dynamic spatiotemporal functionality. This proposed scheme offers a new paradigm for infrared sensors that could provide infrared-color imaging capabilities akin to visible spectrum three-color imaging and photography.","Present technologies utilize intricate assemblies consisting of multiple-color Focal Plane Arrays (FPA) with integrated spectral filters to achieve a limited color response. Conventional Multi-Spectral Imagery (MSI) sensors are designed to have a small number of spectrally distinct bands. Typical instruments have about 10 spectrally unique bands in the visible, near IR, and mid IR. Furthermore, most MSI systems utilize spatially separate focal plane arrays to measure each spectral band. This leads to increased system cost and results in large data volumes that make storage and transmission of data challenging in real time.",Imaging & Optics
A Simplified Approach to Unidirectional Solidification of Silicon,This method is a simplified approach to performing unidirectional solidification of silicon for the creation of upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon for use in photovoltaics for solar energy production.,"Silicon is a key ingredient in the creation of photovoltaic (PV) panels for use in solar cells. Polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon) is the market leading form of silicon for PV applications. Polysilicon is traditionally produced using the Siemens process. However, the Siemens process is relatively expensive. This has created increased interest in the use of “upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon” (UMG) as a replacement for the Siemens process. Creation of UMG involves a key, purity-enhancing step called unidirectional solidification (UDS) of silicon.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Producing Silicon from Silica in an Alternative Furnace to that of the Arc Furnace: A New Approach to Purifying Silicon,"This technology is a new technique of producing silicon from silica in an alternative furnace to the current used arc furnace. With this new technique, the low of solar silicon will dramatically be reduced. Also, the procedure eliminates two primary sources of impurity contamination of the silicon.","Historically, the photovoltaics industry relied on off-spec electronic grade silicon as its primary source of the raw material. As a result of high demands of silicon, the electronics industry not in the business of producing off-specs are at risk of a silicon shortage used for PVs. These reoccurring shortages for high purity silicon spawns interest by many companies to develop procedures for producing low cost solar grade silicon that is 6-nins pure, not 0-nines purity required by the electronics industry.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Micro-Scale Concentrated Photovoltaic Module,"This technology is a thin photovoltaic module that concentrates direct and diffuse sunlight onto each individual solar cell, which increases the efficiency. The concentrator lenses are designed to reduce tracking requirements, making these solar panels ideal for spaces requiring small footprints, such as buildings in dense urban areas. The design also includes a clever means of reducing the PV cell size under each lens so that the cells cool more efficiently.","Achieving concentration of sunlight onto photovoltaic cells in a small form factor has been a challenge. Additionally, gathering light at large angles of incidence, to include diffuse radiation, can improve the collection efficiency by as much as 25%. However, getting both of these features into a thin form factor has not yet been achieved.",Imaging & Optics

Natural Product Modulators of Stress Response,"In response to many stresses, including heat, oxidizing conditions, and exposure to toxic compounds, plant cells up-regulate an evolutionarily conserved set of helper molecules known as heat shock proteins (Hsp).  Increased expression of these proteins protects the organism against stress-induced damage.  The investigators have isolated a secondary metabolite produced by a desert plant-associated fungus that enhances thermotolerance in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, by increasing heat shock protein levels. The metabolite acts by binding specifically to the protein Hsp90, thereby altering its activity and activating a cascade of events known as the heat shock response that leads to thermotolerance in plants.","Investigators at The University of Arizona have identified a microbial metabolite produced by a plant-associated fungal strain that could potentially allow plants to withstand stressful abiotic conditions in extreme environments.  Desert ecosystems are characterized by hot, dry and salt-rich conditions unsuitable for many plants.  Specific physical and structural adaptations have evolved to allow many of the plants inhabiting the desert to thrive under such adverse conditions. It now appears that developing symbiotic relationships with microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria may also be an important strategy adopted by desert plants to enhance their survival.",Life Sciences
Treatment of Gonorrhea,"This patented technology is a method of treatment for gonorrhea that involves the use of a commensal, non-pathogenic microorganism that antagonizes and kills the bacterium responsible for causing gonorrhea.","The CDC estimates that over 700,000 gonorrhea infections occur annually in the US alone. European officials have estimated that 10% of gonorrhea infections in Europe are now caused by antibiotic-resistant strains. The advent and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea has caused the CDC to revise its treatment guidelines, with ceftriaxone being the only currently recommended treatment option for gonorrhea in the US. New therapeutics are therefore actively sought and needed for the treatment of gonorrhea, especially antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.",Life Sciences
Optical Imaging Falloposcope for Minimally Invasive Ovarian Cancer Detection,"This invention provides a minimally invasive, inexpensive, and highly effective diagnostic screening for ovarian cancer in women without requiring general anesthesia or surgery. The invention, a miniature optical imaging device called a falloposcope, combines Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging (MFI) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to generate high-quality images of ovarian tissue that can be used to help determine if the tissue is cancerous. It was developed with inexpensive optical components, works in concert with contrast agents for molecular imaging, and can inherently determine the location of the disease. This invention offers an ideal method for ovarian cancer screening because it is exquisitely sensitive to early neoplastic changes. The falloposcope has been shown in multiple diseases to have high sensitivity and specificity, and provides localization of the cancerous tissue.","Ovarian cancer, the most deadly female reproductive malignancy, has a high mortality rate because there are very few symptoms in the early stages of disease development that allow for early and/or accurate diagnosis. Most cases are diagnosed at stages when the disease has metastasized, making it much more difficult to treat or cure. Although many advances have recently been made in chemotherapy, surgery and the understanding of the genetics of ovarian cancers, little has changed with respect to mortality. In fact, 70% of women who develop ovarian cancer die from it. Therefore, there is a clear clinical need for a viable screening technique for early detection of ovarian cancer.",Imaging & Optics
Motion Correction for PET and SPECT,This invention provides a device and method for correcting motion related artifacts. It does it by detecting motion of the object and using a corresponding algorithm to eliminate the artifact.,"Motion artifacts are disruption in medical images caused by motion of the object being imaged.  The elimination of motion artifacts is important when using multi-modality imaging systems; for example, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), and MRI/SPECT (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). 

During operation, these systems may exhibit image quality that is affected by the motion of the object being imaged. This poses a major problem for patients who have suffered from uncontrollable muscle tremors such as Parkinson’s Disease. These patients struggle to stay still during imaging making it really difficult to obtain a high quality image. Also, images of certain areas of the body, for example the chest, are affected by the movement of the heart and lungs. These motion artifacts cause underestimation and misinterpretation of medical images. For example, images of the lung or brain region suffer from these artifacts and if undetected could lead to misinterpretation by health professionals. This invention addresses these problems.",Life Sciences
Piezo Electric Energy Harvesting System,"This technology is a system that allows for the harvesting of the body’s mechanical energy (e.g. from the heart cycle of contraction-relaxation) and subsequent conversion into electrical energy using piezeoelectric materials. The piezoelectric materials are monolithically integrated with rectifiers and millimeter-scale batteries, allowing for concurrent power generation and storage of harvested electrical energy. The components of this system are coated in a biocompatible material with superior mechanical properties that allow for a uninhibited organ motion while avoiding delamination of the system. These Mechanical Energy Harvesting (MEH) units are arranged in the body with other, identical units in order to increase the power generation capability of the entire system. Results from bovine and ovine models indicate that such a system is easily capable of generating enough power to operate a cardiac pacemaker.","Pacemakers and other similar implantable medical devices suffer from the shortcoming of limited battery life. When the useful life of the batteries powering these devices has expired, surgical procedures are usually necessary to replace them. Like all surgeries, these procedures involve undesirable risk to the patient, patient discomfort, and utilization of healthcare resources that could be put to other uses. Therefore reducing or eliminating the need for performing these replacement procedures is desirable.",Medical Devices
Aerostasis in Pulmonary Surgery,"This invention is a device and method for dispensing fibrin foam onto serosal tissue or lungs after surgery. It consists of three catheters that dispense fibrinogen, thrombin, and pressurized sterile air. The fibrinogen and thrombin are rapidly warmed from 0°C to 37°C, then mixed to form fibrin gel. The fibrin is then mixed with pressurized sterile air to form fibrin foam, and the mixture is sprayed onto the organ tissue or lung surface where there is damage or potential of leakage. The entire device is controlled electronically; sensors measure temperature and pressure, piezoelectric actuators control the pumping pistons, and users interact using a wireless interface.","Serosal tissue damaged during surgery needs to heal, but patients are often at risk of infection during recovery. This can lead to higher morbidity rates, longer hospital stays, or death. Likewise, lung tissue is at risk of leaking after surgery, which causes the same problems. Doctors currently use human fibrin gel to address these issues, but its effectiveness is somewhat limited in practice.",Medical Devices
Sub-Diffraction Limit Resolution in Microscopy,"This invention is a method and device for visualizing sub-diffraction limit resolution microscopy. While the invention has particular utility for testing fracture toughness of thin ceramic substrates, other applications include detection and measurement of sub-micron features and particles such as mold, dust, and various biological particles. A particular feature and advantage of the present invention is that the invention permits resolution to 40 nm (equivalent to λ/10 in visible wavelength), using a conventional polarizing microscope with minimal, low-cost modification.","The Vickers indentation toughness technique is a simple and cost effective procedure. The specimen preparation is relatively simple, requiring only a flat surface. At least 10 tests can be performed on a surface of only 100 mm2. The disadvantage of this technique is that an accurate measurement of the crack length, usually measured under an optical microscope, is difficult. The indentation induced cracks are often hard, if not impossible, to observe because the width of indentation-induced cracks is very narrow, especially near the crack tips that the indention-induced cracks are beyond the resolution of common optical microscopes. Although measurements of the indention induced cracks can be conducted under a scanning electronic microscope (SEM), the usage of a SEM significantly slows down the experimental procedure and greatly increases experiment costs.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Mixture of Estrogens Selective for Estrogen Receptor Beta for Treatment of Neurological or Psychiatric Disorders,"This technology provides a mixture of estrogens that are selective for ER-β activation, offering a novel treatment for neurological and psychological disorders.","Mental disorders are the number one contributor to non-communicable diseases worldwide. Mental disorders such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, substance abuse and dementia contribute more to global disease burden than cancer or cardiovascular diseases. Thus, there is a great need for novel therapeutics that can address these devastating mental disorders.",Life Sciences
SHG Imaging Technique for Assessing Hybrid EO Polymer/Silicon Photonic Integrated Circuits,"Scientists at the University of Arizona have developed a system for assessing the efficiency of the electro-optic (EO) polymer poling process by using multi-photon imaging in the second harmonic generation mode (SHG), permitting imaging and assessment of waveguide devices, including poled polymer devices, prior to, during, and after fabrication.  This system provides depth and lateral spatial resolution up to 1 µm and can be used for multi-layer devices.","The emergence of data center photonics has created a demand for high speed optical modulation on a silicon platform. Electro-optic (EO) polymers integrated with silicon photonics display high EO coefficients, high bandwidths, and excellent silicon compatibility. However, manufacturing these devices requires an electric field poling process that can be difficult to accurately measure or optimize, and can only be done on an otherwise virtually complete device. Defects cannot be detected until the end of the process with conventional quality control means.",Imaging & Optics
Seed Metering System and Apparatus for Precision Planting of Seed,<strong>Background:</strong>,"Currently available seed planters have allowed farmers to plant entire fields in a fraction of the time that was previously required. However, presently available planters have problems regarding the speed and height of seed drop, which lead to inconsistent seed spacing. Although it is well known that reducing the relative velocity between the seed and the soil surface improves seed spacing uniformity, the seed to soil relative velocity of current precision planters is high. Further, conventional planters typically release seed about 2.5 inches above the soil surface. These high relative velocities in the horizontal and vertical directions cause the seed to bounce and roll on the soil surface, resulting in poor seed spacing accuracy.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Hybrid Microbial-Enzymatic Fuel Cell,This invention is a fuel cell that uses microbial reacts as an energy source. This process allows for continuous maintenance of the open circuit voltage of the fuel cell over the same time period without replacement of the active media. Even without media replacement the fuel cell designed runs stably making it more practical for industrial applications.,"Enzymatic and microbial fuel cell offers a couple advantages over the standard metal based fuel cell. Enzymes are relatively easy to mass-produce. Enzymes are also specifically designed to process organic compounds such as sugars and alcohols, which are common in nature. Because sugars and other biofuels can be grown and harvested on a massive scale, the fuel for enzymatic biofuel cells is extremely cheap and can be found in nearly any part of the world, making this technology an extraordinarily attractive option from a logistics standpoint and for those concerned with the adoption of renewable energy sources.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
High Efficient Continuous Wave and Mode-Locked Lasers Powered by Solar Energy,"Faculty at the University of Arizona have developed a compact, efficient solar-powered laser that uses triple junction photovoltaic cells to power semiconductor and mode-locked lasers. Existing solar-pumped lasers use an arc-metal-halide lamp pump that requires bulky concentrating optics and is power inefficient. By using a triple junction photovoltaic cell, the laser can produce a sunlight to laser light efficiency of over 10 percent without cooling and concentration optics. This system is more efficient, lower cost and more compact than direct solar pumped lasers. The technology can greatly improve renewable energy production and power beaming applications.","Electric powered lasers consume a significant amount of energy and only operate at about 1 to 2 percent efficiency. In an effort to conserve energy and expand the application of lasers outside of energy-available locations, solar-pumped laser research is growing rapidly and yields technology that harvests commercial potential.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Geopolymer Fly Ash Brick With Phase Change Material added for Energy Savings in Buildings,This invention is a method of reducing energy consumption related to space cooling and heating in a building by incorporating phase change material in geopolymer concrete wall. The results are very promising and indicate that the geopolymer concrete with incorporated PCM shows only little decrease of the compressive strength and is very effective in controlling heat flow.,"Extensive research has been conducted on different methods for enhancing the energy efficiency related to space heating and cooling in buildings. Of these different methods, utilization of phase change material (PCM) has attracted the most attention. PCM has high latent heat capacity and can absorb or release large amount of heat within a narrow temperature range. By incorporating PCM with a suitable phase transition temperature and enthalpy in the exterior walls of a building, on daytime the PCM will prevent too much outside heat from entering the building by changing phase to store the extra solar heat as “latent heat” and at night the PCM will release the stored heat into the building if the inside temperature is too low. The results are a more comfortable inside environment with fewer temperature peaks and valleys, and a reduction in energy demand for cooling and heating.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Combined Algal Harvester and Mixer,"This invention combines an eloctrocoagulatlon harvesting system and a traditional paddlewheel to harvest algae while mixing a traditional reactor allowing the harvesting to take place in the reactor system. In addition, this process is energy efficient which is the largest obstacle preventing sustainable bio fuels from hitting the market.","Currently water will be mixed using a paddlewheel and then at a later point the water will be pumped out of the system where the algae is extracted from the water.

Fiber-Based Bidirectional Optical Parametric Oscillator for Precision Sensing,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed an all-fiber, synchronously pumped, bidirectional optical parametric oscillator (OPO) for precision sensing applications. The all-fiber design removes the need for free-space alignment and adjustment. The design overcomes the limitations of existing laser gyros by increasing the sensing area for better measurement sensitivity, minimizing the lock-in effect, and reducing the cost, complexity, and size. The system and techniques are applicable to a variety of different fiber optic ring laser sensors.","He-Ne ring lasers are currently being used as active laser gyroscopes in highly demanding applications such as aircraft and satellite navigation. Current designs are expensive, heavy, bulky, sensitive to electromagnetic interference, and have lifetime limitations. Furthermore, these gyroscopes suffer from the lock-in effect, which results in low sensitivity at low rotation rates.",Imaging & Optics
Control of Microbial Growth via Novel Regulatory Events in the TORC Pathway,"This invention relates to systems, methods, and compositions for treating or preventing diseases associated with eukaryotic organisms, more particularly to methods and compositions for directly or indirectly triggering and/or permitting, or inhibiting Raptor/Kog1 aggregation in specific eukaryotes. This technology is a proposed class of novel drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by eukaryotic organisms, and a method of screening for such drugs.

Core Shell Nanofibers for Tissue Engineering of Scaffolds for Stem Cells,This technology is a method of coaxial electrospinning used to fabricate PVA and gelatin into defect-free composite nanofibers with PVA in the core and gelatin in the shell. These nanofibers can be used as composite scaffolds for a variety of applications including tissue engineering and scaffolds for stem cells.,"Electrospinning as a versatile fiber-formation technique has evolved from generating uniform, single-component fibers to creating complex, multiple-component composite fibers with spatially and/or temporally controlled properties. The high specific surface areas, porosities, and micro/nanoscale features of electrospun fibers provide new and/or enhanced functions that are not obtainable from bulk materials and are thus useful for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound healing, and medical implants. Scaffolds composed of synthetic polymers often have desirable mechanical properties but display minimal bioactivity because of their insufficient cellular recognition sites. In contrast, scaffolds composed solely of natural proteins tend to have high bioactivity but lack the mechanical strength needed for in vivo applications. The fabrication of composite nanofiber scaffolds that integrate the mechanical strength of synthetic polymers and the bioactivity of natural proteins may address the unmet need in vascular tissue engineering.",Life Sciences

This technology is poised to take advantage of a growing opportunity in the surgical medical device field.","Electronics and digital devices have become mainstream, but a basic limitation still exists. Electronics are created from conductors and generally these materials are stiff or rigid (copper, aluminum, etc). On the other hand, biologic domains are flexible and complaint and there have been recent advances in stretchable electronics. There is a need to measure or monitor locations of the body that are isolated or walled off. Surgical sites need a measurement of oxygen tension, pH, and temperature.",Materials
Modulation of Platelet Function,This novel invention provides a method to limit the effects of shear stress from MCS devices on the platelet cells of patients with congestive heart failure. The invention has been shown to reduce platelet activation and aggregation in vivo by mitigating the effects of shear stress by increasing platelet membrane fluidity.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over 17 million deaths per year. At the beginning of the 20th century, cardiovascular disease was responsible for less than 10% of all deaths worldwide, but by the start of the 21st century, CVD was responsible for about 30% of all deaths worldwide. Anti-platelet drugs are often used to prevent and/or treat cardiovascular diseases, and these drugs are in high demand. Although oral and IV anti-platelet medications may prevent the formation of blood clots, blood platelets of patients with mechanical circulatory support devices are subject to higher levels of shear physical stress. This leads to a higher incidence of platelet activation and aggregation, which may lead to increased thrombosis.",Life Sciences
Optical Device for In-Line and Real-Time Monitoring of Microalgae,"This invention is an optical-based sensor system which uses wavelengths and laser technology to monitor microalgae in real-time. The emitted wavelengths range from 650nm to 850nm for the purpose of determining biomass concentration. The device is able to measure the following: cell concentration, size, reflectivity of particles, intensity of color, and turbidity of the solution.","Current methods of measuring biological variables such as cell mass concentration, cell size, cell morphology, population composition, pigments, and liquid content are currently either prohibitively expensive, too laborious, or destructive to be employed for real-time monitoring and control. Existing sensors for each individual application are mostly designed for environmental concentrations and as such are not suited for microalgae growth.

Tracking System for Agriculturally Produced Crops,"Researchers at The University of Arizona College of Agriculture and Life Sciences are extending the Tracing System for Agriculturally Produced Crops by adding the ability to georeference (at the carton-level) cut and packed iceberg lettuce to a precise field location at the Yuma County Cooperative Extension in Yuma, AZ. The system uses RFID and integrated GPS technologies to provide a field georeference for the carton containing the freshly cut and packed produce.","U.S. food producers have developed sophisticated systems to track the flow of food along the supply chain, for example, tracking food from the retailer back to the farm or a key point in the production process. Leafy vegetables such as iceberg lettuce are packed into cardboard cartons in the field at the harvest site. This reduces mechanical damage during handling and subsequent transportation to market, and also allows quality attributes – such as field efficiency or postharvest quality – to be identified early in the supply chain.

Consumer demand for minimally processed fresh produce heightens the risk of produce contamination by pathogens which can heighten the decay process and, in some cases, make consumers seriously ill. The ability to trace contaminated produce back to a specific field location is critical to the rapid and effective control and mitigation of a food-borne illness outbreak.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Domain of a Protein Antigen from Coccidioides immitis which Induces Protection Against Coccidoidal Infection,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have determined the precise conformation required to confer resistance to C. immitis or Valley Fever, which is endemic to Southwestern United States, Mexico, and other Latin American countries. They have identified a subunit of C. immitis antigen that would both prevent coccidioidomycosis and optimize the vaccine dose in turn reducing any negative side effects from vaccination. Injecting an individual with an antigenic subunit eliminates the presence of unneeded genetic sequences from the vaccine. This reduces the risks associated with the more common whole-cell vaccine injection.","Coccidioidomycosis ensues after infection with the fungus Coccidioides immitis (""Valley Fever""). The body is usually able to resolve the infection without treatment within a few weeks to a few months, and the individual's immune system is almost completely resistant to a second infection. However, some cases are unable to resolve the infection and must succumb to extensive and sometimes lifelong antifungal treatment. A vaccine to C. immitis has been tested but resulted in excessive pain and inflammation at the injection site making the method unacceptable. Development of a more potent vaccination against C. immitis infection would enable researchers to create a low dose vaccine in turn alleviating problems with pain and inflammation.",Life Sciences
Electro-Optic Waveguide Modulator with Low Insertion Loss,"This invention relates to methods for improving the properties of photorefractive materials to improve the performance, particularly the grating or image persistency of photorefractive materials. One method is to utilize multiple layers, interposing one or more polymer layers between the transparent electrode layer and the photorefractive material.","Photorefractivity is a phenomenon in which the refractive index of a material can be altered by changing the electric field within the material, such as by laser beam irradiation. Good photorefractive properties can be seen in materials that combine good charge generation, good charge transport or photoconductivity, and good electro-optical activity. Typically, a high biased voltage is applied to photorefractive materials to obtain good photorefractive behavior. While using a high biased voltage can result in a longer grating persistency, the use of a high voltage in the photorefractive material can cause the photorefractive grating to disappear almost immediately after stopping the applied biased voltage. Therefore, there is a strong need to improve grating holding persistency, even if the biased voltage is stopped and no voltage is being applied.",Imaging & Optics
Snapshot Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer with Achromatic Wollaston Prisms,"Researchers at The University of Arizona have developed a novel device that answers challenges of increased robustness and faster acquisition time. This new device has no moving mechanical parts, mounts directly onto the focal plane imaging array, and acquires both the spectral and spatial information at once. Thus, this new device is significantly more robust than its predecessors in the field, and it offers a true snapshot capability. Its form factor is also significantly reduced with respect to its predecessors. Furthermore, due the device’s passive design, it does not require any power to operate beyond what is needed for the image capture and signal processing hardware.","Today’s applications of remote sensing demand information of increasing sophistication. In particular, there is a need to obtain detailed spatial and spectral information over a short period of time (e.g., to counter motion blur). Though a number of imaging spectrometer technologies have emerged in recent years, they are often technologically complex and lack the snapshot capability, which makes them susceptible to mechanical stress, vibration, and motion. Therefore, there is a need to develop imaging spectrometer hardware that is mechanically robust and features snapshot image acquisition.",Imaging & Optics
Distributed Feedback Fiber Laser Pumped by Multimode Diode Lasers,"Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences and Canada's Carleton University recently succeeded in fabricating high reflectivity (&gt;99%) Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) into phosphate glass fibers using UV light and a phase mask technique. With this new manufacturing technique, fiber lasers can be created as single monolithic units that are more stable, with higher efficiencies and shorter manufacturing times than lasers created by conventional manufacturing techniques. These FBGs show high thermal stability making them suitable for fiber lasers operating at high average power laser operation. Not only are the FBGs stable when exposed to temperatures up to 170C for extended periods (hundreds of hours), but the reflectivity actually increases under such conditions.","The holographic technique for writing gratings in silica-based optical fibers has garnered interest in development of high performance single fiber lasers and other optical devices that benefit from the grating being formed in the fiber. However, silica fibers need to be short in length to prevent mode-hopping, and germano-silicate fibers have low pump absorption and suffer from ion clustering when the dopant concentration is increased. Phosphate glass fibers are much less prone to clustering and can be highly doped, but they are much less photosensitive, so that the conventional holographic side writing technique does not work well. In the past, creation of phosphate glass fiber lasers has meant splicing together fibers of different refractive indexes to create the laser cavity.",Imaging & Optics
An Imaging Polarimetric Camera,Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed the concept for a camera system that is able to perform polarimetric imaging with ease while simultaneously implementing instrumentation that reduces polarization artifacts. The system uses technology currently existing in handheld cameras to perform polarization imaging in a novel way that allows for quick image acquisition as well as rugged design. The camera is run with one-click operation and a rapid four-image sequence acquisition. This system has potential to be used in a myriad of applications ranging from medical imaging to military surveillance.,"Polarization is a characteristic of light that few cameras exploit, but that can be used to give additional characterization to objects in a scene. For example, it has been shown that polarization can be used to distinguish manmade objects in natural surroundings. Also, polarization has demonstrated utility in biomedical imaging where abnormal tissues may be more readily detected through the use of polarimetry. Notwithstanding the advantages given by polarimetry, implementation of polarimetric cameras has been difficult due to the mechanically high tolerances needed to provide good accuracy and reliability in such systems. Artifacts commonly appear in polarization images due to edge effects and image alignment. Therefore, effective instrumentation for polarimetric cameras needs to be developed to mitigate these effects.",Imaging & Optics
High Power Mid-Infrared Supercontinuum Fiber Lasers at 2-5 µm,Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a supercontinuum laser that has high power output over the 2-5 micron wavelength range.,There are various methods for generating a mid-infrared laser source. The problem commonly faced is that it is difficult to emit on a supercontinuum in the IR region. Most competing lasers emit no higher than 2.4 micrometers with a relatively low power.,Imaging & Optics
Axially Scanning to Determine Slopes of Aspheric Surfaces,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a system for testing the figure and finish of optical surfaces or any other curved surface using a Shack-Hartmann type of method, wherein a pattern can be projected onto the surface and then its returned image can be analyzed. The patterns can be varied to optimize the returned information regarding slope details of a variety of shapes. The SCOTS technology can be used on a rough surface as well as on the nearly-finished surface.","Testing of aspheric and freeform surfaces can be challenging at best using conventional interferometric techniques.  Interferometers deliver precise information about surface departures from the ideal surface, but require the finish and polishing to be at a relatively advanced stage. Typically, multiple instruments at different wavelengths must be used to cover testing from the initial polishing runs to the final runs.",Imaging & Optics

Optical Membrane Formation System Method,This invention relates to the field of membrane formation and in particular relates to the formation of optical membranes on optical surfaces such as prisms and the like. A spectroscopy system has at least one light source operable to generate a source beam and a prism having a rear surface. A support block is disposed on the rear surface of the prism. The support block is formed with at least one sample well having a center and defines a substantially vertical rear cell surface having a center. The source beam is aimed at the sample well. A syringe filled with a membrane solution and having a needle with a distal end disposed in front of the sample well. The distal end is aimed at a point above the center of the rear cell surface. The syringe is operable to eject a steady stream of membrane solution from the needle onto the circular rear cell surface thereby forming a membrane defining at least a portion of a layer under test. The membrane has a substantially uniform thickness that covers the entire rear cell surface. The system also includes a detector operable to detect light that is at least one of reflected and scattered by the layer under test.,"In the case of surface plasmon resonance systems, a light-reflecting surface is coated with a thin metallic coating. Light at a specific incident angle excites the electrons in the metal. This results in a localized fluctuation of the electron density known as surface plasmons. The light energy transferred to the metal coating during excitation results in an attenuation of the reflected light intensity. The incident angle and degree of the attenuation depends on the wavelength of the light and the thickness and optical properties of the interface in contact with the metal coating. 
 
The important optical properties of such an interface include the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, the refractive index, and the thickness of the interface. The effective distance of Surface Plasmon penetration is only sever hundred nanometers (nm) so only the environment at the surface is detected. This property makes Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Plasmon Waveguide Resonance (PWR) ideal for measuring surface and interfacial chemistry, as well as the properties of thin film coating properties (including molecular films).",Life Sciences
Beam Shifting Surface Plasmon Resonance System and Method,"The invention relates to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system method. The system has at least one light source operable to generate a source beam, a prism having a rear surface at least partially coated with metallic coating and optionally a dielectric layer. At least one layer under test is positioned on the rear surface of the prism. The source beam is directed at the layer under test thereby defining an angle between the source beam and the rear surface of the prism. A detector is operable to detect light that is reflected or scattered by the layer under test. The source beam is directed towards the layer under test at a selected angle. The source beam is also shifted in at least one plane to illuminate a specific portion of the layer under test based on the selected relative angle and the position of the layer under test on the rear surface of the prism. The rear surface of the prism can be illuminated in one dimensional or two dimensional array like fashion.","It is understood that when a light-reflecting surface is coated with a thin metallic coating, then light at a specific incident angle can excite the electrons in the metal. This results in localized fluctuations of the electron density known as surface plasmons. The light energy transferred to the metal coating during excitation results in an attenuation of the reflected light intensity. The incident angle and degree of attenuation depends on the wavelength of the wavelength of the exciting light and the thickness and optical properties of the interface in contact with the metal coating. 
 
The important optical properties of such an interface include the absorbance at the excitation wavelength (extinction coefficient), the refractive index, and the thickness of the interface.

This property makes Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Plasmon Waveguide Resonance (PWR) ideal for measuring surface and interfacial chemistry, as well as the properties of thin film coating properties (including molecular films). PWR is essentially a species of SPR however, PWR techniques utilize one or more dielectric coatings over the metallic coating.",Life Sciences
Holographic Lens / Mirror Aperture (HL/MA) Design for Hybrid Thermal Solar Systems,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have designed a hybrid solar collection and distribution system to optimize the use of the solar collector footprint as well as the solar spectrum. The system splits the spectrum into two components to distribute the peak wavelengths for algae growth, PV, and thermal uses. Algae responds best to photosynthesis wavelengths (400-700 nm) whereas photovoltaic cells and thermal collectors respond well to different and broader spectral ranges. In the UArizona design, one wavelength band is focused by a holographic lens through a mirror aperture onto a ground target, landing uniformly within the shadow of the mirror. The rest of the spectrum passes through the lens, reflects off of the mirror, and lands on the thermal or photovoltaic receiver. The design accommodates four different geometries, including thermal mirror arrays and photovoltaic arrays, so is versatile in its applicability.","With the increased interest in biofuels, such as algae, and in efficient use of solar radiation collectors, a need exists to optimize the energy efficiencies of the ground footprint. Several designs currently exist to spread the solar spectrum for optimization of PV conversion to electricity, but they don't address thermal conversion or biofuel needs. Biofuels such as algae exhibit better growth if they are protected from portions of solar radiation outside of the photosynthesis band of 400nm to 700nm. Thermal needs can tap a different broad portion of the solar spectrum than PV. Solar collectors, for PV or thermal, and algae farms take up large footprints of real estate. The most efficient method of solar-based energy production would utilize one footprint for all three forms of solar-based energy production. The design by the UArizona researchers not only provides a means of using one footprint for collecting light for all forms, but optimizes the algae production as well as the thermal or photovoltaic conversion efficiencies.","Energy, Cleantech & Environmental"
Glass Implemented Display,"A University of Arizona researcher has designed a see-through display device to be directly embedded within the lens(es) of a pair of glasses or goggles. The device produces a displayed image for the user with minimal obstruction of vision or field of view. The UA invention improves upon current designs by directly embedding the display into the glass, allowing the user the same field of view as with normal eye-wear. It works for prescription lenses or non-prescription, greatly enhancing the utility of the device.","Most competing products take up a larger space for the display, allowing the user to see through the display but limiting the field of view around it. Such displays cannot be embedded within the lens itself without distortion of the lens prescription.",Imaging & Optics
A Method for Improving Spectrum Sensing/Efficiency in Cognitive Wireless Systems,"To improve the sensing efficiency and/or the throughput for the SUs, this technology develops a new adaptation method that exploits selfinterference suppression (SIS) capabilities in an SU device. Using this adaptation method, an SU can switch between a transmission-sensing (TS) mode and transmission-reception (TR) mode.","In a DSA environment, wireless devices may be operated by primary (non-adaptive) and secondary (adaptive/cognitive) users. Secondary users (SUs) are allowed to access the spectrum opportunistically on a non-licensed basis, provided that they do not harm the transmissions of primary users (PUs). Until recently, the idea that a wireless device can transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency channel, i.e., operate in full-duplex (FD) mode, was deemed impossible. The traditional scenario was that at a given time, a node can transmit or receive, but not both, which is often called half-duplex (HD) operation. The problem of achieving FD communications is that the transmitted power from a given device is typically much larger than the received power of another signal that this device is trying to capture. While the device is receiving the second signal, its own transmitted signal is considered self-interference. The infeasibility of FD communications has recently been challenged in several efforts, which have successfully demonstrated the possibility of FD communications using self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques. The main novelty of these efforts is to suppress self-interference to a level that enables FD communications. A commonly accepted scheme for protecting Pus from SU transmissions is the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT). In the LBT scheme, an SU device has to periodically interrupt its transmission (e.g., once every two seconds) and senses the channel for PU activity (transmissions). To do that, SUs must sense the PU communications activity over the wireless channel, an inherent problem of which in the traditional LBT scheme is that it results in a reduction in the SU throughput.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Small Molecule Therapeutics for L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia,"This invention provides a novel therapeutic for the reduction of levodopa-induced dyskinesia associated with the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. This invention has been demonstrated to have a statistically significant effect upon dyskinesia compared to amantadine, the only drug currently given for dyskinesia treatment. This invention is for use in conjunction with levodopa drug therapy for patients with Parkinson’s disease to reduce the effects of levodopa-induced dyskinesia.","Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, with an incidence of about 2% in the population over 60 years. Parkinson’s is known to cause the loss of motor skills, such as bradykinesia, postural instability, resting tremor, and rigidity. The precursor of dopamine, levodopa, is highly effective in relieving Parkinson’s motor symptoms during the first years of administration (the so-called “honeymoon period”). However, over time, patients start experiencing side effects of levodopa usage, such as development of abnormal involuntary movements, known as dyskinesia. It has been reported that within 5 years of treatment with levodopa, about 50% of the patients develop these motor complications in response to levodopa administration. This percentage rises to about 90% after the first decade. Therefore, the appearance of dyskinesia represents a serious limitation to the use of this therapeutic agent in advanced Parkinson’s.

There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia associated with Parkinson’s disease. Although levodopa is the most effective known treatment for the stiffness, tremors, spasms and poor muscle control associated with Parkinson’s disease, levodopa’s significant side effects and loss of efficacy after prolonged periods of use make effective treatment of Parkinson’s extremely difficult.",Life Sciences
Metal Free Scalable Synthesis of Fluorinated Indole and Benzofuran Structures,This technology is a novel one step method to generate fluorinated aryl groups for use in various other reactions.,"There are few alternative existing methods to treat arrhythmia. Originally, there were a slew of powerful anti arrhythmic drugs on the market which had the potential to treat the cardiovascular condition. However, the majority of these drugs were revealed to actually increase mortality rates rather than decrease them. This left only two major compounds in the field, dronedarone and amiodarone.
 
Another way to treat arrhythmia is the pacemaker. While a pacemaker can monitor the heart to identify electrical activity while being able to modulate the rhythm of the heart itself, it is only a temporary fix. Unlike its drug counterparts, a pacemaker does not address the core problem of arrhythmia, it only addresses the symptoms.",Materials
Novel Inhibitors of GAB1,The compounds discovered in this patented technology could be used as a breast cancer therapeutic drug.,"Outside of biological treatments, there are other ways to treat cancer including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually only used in cancer that is isolated in one place and not metastasized cancer. Chemotherapy has ill side-effects due to it targeting many fast growing cells. Radiation therapy has the potential to kill even non harmful cells.
 
Within biological treatments, there are four main categories. The first is rituximab, which can target antigens on cancerous cells, which in turn can signal antigens on B-cells. These B-cells can then lyse the cancerous cells. One major advantage that the invention has over these types of therapies is versatility. In order to target specific antigens, the drug must be specifically made to do this. Antigens differ from cell to cell, so different drugs have to be made to target different cell types.
 
Another type of treatment involves removing the immune system’s inability to attack the body’s own cells. A drug such as ipillimumab can allow immune cells to attack body tissue. This opens up a large possibility of immune cells attacking tissue that is not cancerous or harmful. Therefore, a variety of autoimmune issues may emerge from this treatment path.
 
A third type of biological cancer treatment involves attaching a cell-killing substance onto an antibody. When the antibody binds onto a cancerous cell antigen, the cancer cell with intake the cell-killing substance, and promptly undergo cell death. Again, there is the chance that an ordinary, non cancerous cell may uptake this substance and undergo apoptosis.
 
The fourth treatment is inhibitory biological compounds like the invention. In addition to inhibiting GAB1, there are compounds which inhibit other molecules like growth effectors such as cetuximab and panitumumab. Unlike the invention, these treatments are usually specific to cancer that is caused by a mutation in the KRAS gene.",Life Sciences
Assay Device with Tunable Array of Unique Steady-State Microfluidic Gradients,"This invention is an assay device based on the common T-shaped microfluidic geometry to produce an array of unique gradients. The Assay Device with Tunable Array of Unique Steady-State Microfluidic Gradients contains two reservoir channels, an intersection point, a source and sink channel, an array of microchannels and a shared exit port. Within the device there are two gradients developed: one that forms along the length of the source channel and another within the perpendicular set of microchannels. The magnitude of the gradient intensity relies on the ratio of the two flow inlets without the use of valves or other mixers. Gradient intensities within the device can be easily programmed in order to conduct many distinct experiments simultaneously. Although there are many microfluidic devices that can generate gradients, this is the only device that can generate gradients across a broad spectrum of intensities by changing the ratio of the two flow inlets. Patent filed.","The development of artificial molecular gradients is an essential part of understanding fundamental physiological processes through research. Experimental platforms, like microfluidics devices mimic aspects of cellular microenvironments in order to understand how cells respond to gradients.

Repairable Data Blocks and Method of Data Block Reconstruction for Large Scale Cloud Storage Systems,This invention is a new approach to reinforcing the storage system by storing the data with specifically placed redundancies that reduce the chance that all copies of the same data will be lost simultaneously. The invention also allows for possible reconstruction of lost data using remaining data.,"Online cloud computing systems utilizing distributed data storage actually divide the information into “blocks” which are stored amongst several different nodes. If and when some of these nodes fail, the blocks they are storing can be at least temporarily lost, causing the aggregate information to become fragmented. Usually this is remedied by storing additional copies as a failsafe, but this can be costly.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Method and Apparatus for Deep Ultraviolet Microscopy,"Researchers at the University of Arizona  and formerly at UC San Diego have developed a nanometer resolution optical microscope. It uses an intense, monochromatic radiation of the atomic Hydrogen line (H Lyman-alpha light source) for the improved imaging resolution. The light source emits at a wavelength in which there is a local minimum of the air absorption spectrum, allowing effective transmission in air and obviating the need for the target to be in a high vacuum. The light source can increase optical imaging resolution by fourfold, which making  optical microscopy more useful for semiconductor inspection and life sciences research.","Optical microscopes have many applications in both industry and life sciences. In the semiconductor industry, visible light microscopes have been used for quality inspection because of their non-destructive advantage over electron microscopy, which can be damaging to the semiconductor wafers. However, as feature sizes in the semiconductor industry decrease, and as the need for small-feature resolution in life sciences grows, visible optical microscopes are no longer ideal for these applications.  Microscopy that has nanometer scale or smaller resolution that is also non-damaging to the target features is highly desirable.",Imaging & Optics
"""Rock Softening"" Method and Apparatus for Efficient Drilling","This invention is a method for improved material weakening including rocks, concrete, and other man-made materials. The method established uses an imbalance between the rate of energy input and the rate of energy dissipation in the material resulting in a more significantly more efficient material breakage process. This imbalance is established by reducing the rate of energy dissipation, employing a chemical and/or electric field potential induced in the material. The chemical approach creates a layer of zero zeta potential at the contact between the rock and the tool. The electric field approach prevents the formation of a charged layer at the contact between the rock and the tool, by blocking the transport of charged defects away from the point of high stress concentration (contact between the rock and the tool). This process is then monitored in real time where the chemical and/or electric field potential strength can be adjusted to cancel the rate of charged defects transport.","Efficient extraction techniques is a key element for a healthy and profitable minerals industry. Currently drilling, sawing, crushing, and grinding of rock are among the most energy intensive processes in the production of precious and industry metals. With the United States using approximately 1,246 trilling BTU/year of energy from fossil fuels and electricity there is a great need to reduce the energy requirement related to this industry. Drilling takes up 1% of the total energy consumption in the United States; with drilling and grinding being 25% of that total energy figure. (US Department of Energy) There is a dire need for optimized drilling techniques in this country.

A Vector System for Direct Cloning of Eukaryotic Gene Constructs,"Yeast-Agrobacterium-Bacteria (YAB) is a combination of two technologies: yeast recombination capabilities and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT). Generation of ATMT constructs usually requires PCR-amplification of DNA fragments and multiple cloning steps into binary Agrobacterium vectors. YAB is a plasmid vector that can be used to combine in one single step several kinds of DNA fragments using the yeast recombination machinery instead of restriction and ligation enzymes, producing a construct that can afterwards be used to introduce the combined DNA fragments into fungi, plants and other suitable organisms, including human cells. University of Arizona faculty created YAB by combining a yeast plasmid with origins of replication for yeast and for bacteria with all the essential parts of an Agrobacterium plasmid necessary to infect cells (plant, fungal) and transfer DNA (Ti plasmid), and origin of replication for Agrobacterium cells. Construction of any plasmid construct designed using the YAB platform can be achieved in one single step.","Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) has become the preferred (and at times the only functional) method to introduce modified genes in many fungal systems.

Exploiting Novel Pseudomonas Syringae Bacteriocins as Antibacterials,"This invention relates to a method of controlling phytopathogens through bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of bacterial plant pathogens. This method reduces the number of bacteria found on the surface of a plant. Specifically, this invention relates in one embodiment to Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae) strains tailored to controlling phytopathogens.","Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae) is a phenotypically and ecologically diverse plant pathogen able to infect an array of host plants. Species of P. syringae is divided (largely based on phenotype) into 50 pathovars that cause a variety of diseases (such as bacterial speck, spot, blight, galls, and cankers) on a remarkable range of plant hosts including apples, beans, cucumbers, oats, peas, tomato, tobacco, and rice, as well as other ornamental and crop plants. P. syringae causes economically important crop losses in the U.S. including losses to various fruit trees, cruciferous, and tomatoes, among others. In addition to current crop losses sustained by P. syringae, this group of closely related pathogens present a perpetual risk to worldwide agriculture because of their high degree of genomic plasticity where they regularly acquire genetic material from environmental sources.
 
Control strategies that have been historically used, including copper-based bactericides and antibiotics (chiefly oxytetracycline and streptomycin), have largely lost their efficacy due to the acquisition and dissemination of resistance genes in pathogen populations. Alternative methods for controlling bacterial plant diseases, include cultivation of naturally resistant varieties, developing crops with enhanced resistance through traditional breeding programs, or engineering crops for resistance through introduction of resistance (R) genes.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Identification of Endohyphal Bacterial Symbionts as Major Determinants of Cellulase and Ligninase Activity in Fungi,<strong>Background:</strong>,"Plant-associated fungi play important ecological roles as pathogens, mycorrhizae, endophytes, and saprotrophs. As endophytes, Fungi colonize healthy, living plant tissues, providing protection from pathogens, herbivores, and other environmental stressors such as drought. As saprotrophs, Fungi are the primary decomposers of senescent plant materials, breaking down both lignin and cellulose, the major components of plant cell walls. Many Fungi can fill more than one of these roles in their lifecycle. One potential mechanism influencing ecological lifestyle switches of Fungi is the presence of other microbial symbionts, including endohyphal bacteria (EBH). Cellulase activity is thought to be important in the lifecycle of horizontally transmitted endophytes, which must penetrate host plant tissues during the colonization process. Ligninase activity is also thought to be important in the lifecycle of horizontally transmitted endophytes, which must penetrate host plant tissues during the colonization process. Many endophytes also have saprotrophic stages in their life cycles, during which cellulase and linginase activity is thought to be highly important for nutrient acquisition.",Agriculture & Horticulture

Method for Detecting Iron-Specific Hypercoagulation,"This technology is a novel method for detecting clotting parameters related to iron-specific hypercoagulation in settings such as sickle cell disease, hemodialysis, mechanical circulatory support and repeated blood transfusions.","Iron-mediated hypercoagulation is the result of increased plasma concentrations of iron. Utilizing information about the underlying molecular mechanisms of blood clotting recently discovered at the University of Arizona, this technology provides a method for detecting clotting parameters related to iron-specific hypercoagulation present in blood samples taken from patients. This information can then be compared to known values obtained from control samples to make clinical determinations. Patients who are high risk for hypercoagulation can then be subjected to chelation treatment to prevent clotting in organs.",Life Sciences
Targeting the PH/DH Domain of Tiam1 for the Treatment and/or Prevention of Bone Metastases,"Tiam1 is a highly conserved exchange factor that is over-expressed in many cancers, including prostate cancer (CRPCA). Increase in Tiam1 expression is associated with increased metastases and correlates with poor PCA patient survival prognosis. This patented technology has identified a novel compound which exhibits the ability to reduce prostate cancer bone metastasis by binding to the cPH domain of Tiam1 and inhibiting its cellular functions.","Prostate Cancer (PCA) is a heterogeneous disease and the 5-year survival rate for men whose cancer has metastasized at the time of diagnosis being 34%, however, if the cancer is detected prior to metastasis the 5-year survival rate increases to nearly 100%. Although most patients respond to androgen suppression by entering into clinical remission, they eventually develop more aggressive tumors that are castration-resistant PCA (CRPCA). While there are currently numerous drugs designed to inhibit metastatic cells and bone, there are currently none which target CRPCA.",Life Sciences
FIB Aggregation,"This technology is a method of dynamically updating and aggregating changes to forwarding information base (FIB) in real time that is configurable depending on need of end user. By developing a more holistic and configurable approach to FIB aggregation and prioritization, this technology has proven ability to improve efficiency of both newer and older equipment as well as extend its usability.","The technique of FIB aggregation reduces FIB size by combining entries whose prefixes are numerically aggregatable and whose next hops are the same. It is a software solution that can be applied to a single router without upgrading the hardware, changing the control plane, or affecting packets’ forwarding paths. Thus it can be deployed incrementally and selectively in a network at operators’ discretion. With the proliferation of internet enabled devices, millions of new addresses are added to internet routing and forwarding tables annually. This causes architectural, efficiency, and topological issues on older routers and switches connecting data networks as they begin approaching their table limits on the number of entities causing service problems for content and access providers alike. Current growth rates are challenging even the most technologically advanced routers as well. While the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is searching for architectural solutions, large customers are reluctant to invest in new equipment that may have to be replaced near-term.",Software & Information Technology
A Novel Gd-Sucrose Scaffold for Oral Administration in MR-Colonography at 7 T,"This invention is a Gadolinium-DOTA sucrose-derived agent synthesized with eight Gadolinium-DOTA chelates per sucrose and a molecular structure to induce stiffness and increase the rotational correlation time. For in vivo assessment, SCID mice were intra-rectally injected with human CRC cells. Then, the mice received the Gadolinium-DOTA sucrose-derived agent by oral gavage, which increased tumor visualization by 40% above MRI with no contrast agent. Only mice with tumors (n=4) showed traces of the Gd-DOTA sucrose molecule in the bladder, compared to control mice (n=3) with no signal.","Approximately 50,000 people died of colon cancer annually, making it the second leading cause of cancer morbidity in the United States. Early detection has been shown to greatly improve prognosis (5yr survival  Stage I:87% vs. Stage IV:12%), and the American Cancer Society recommends that everyone have a colonoscopy every ten years starting at age 50. Even with these guidelines, only 40% of CRCs are detected early, as colonoscopy is expensive, invasive, and requires sedation and a cathartic bowel preparation, resulting in patient non-compliance.  

A less invasive method of early cancer detection has been developed using a Gadolinium-DOTA-sucrose-derived agent taken orally. The molecule is trapped in the small bowel in healthy subjects (until rectally passed) but in subjects with colonic polyps or cancerous lesions, it disperses out of the colon possibly due to destruction of the mucosal layer and is secreted in the urine. Urine analysis can then be used to identify subjects with possible neoplasms in a non-invasive manner. The scaffold might also be linked to tumor targeted ligands to enhance MR colonography.
 
The market is attractive as evidenced by the market capitalization of Exact Sciences of approximately $2B with what analysts are calling an addressable market of almost $1B.  Exact Sciences’ product Cologuard was just approved in August 2014, and looks at the methylation of NDRG4 and BMP3, KRAS point mutations and does an ELISA assay to determine the concentration of hemoglobin in a patient stool sample. However, there may be room for multiple products in this market particularly for products where the patients do not need to collect their own stools.
 
A patient can drink the Gadolinium-DOTA-sucrose-derived agent, and the presence of colonic lesions or cancer could be detected with a simple urine analysis, and substituting another lanthanide metal Europium for Gadolimium may result in an even more sensitive assay. Methods such as CT and MR-colonography are emerging as non-invasive options, but also require a bowel cleanse, are insensitive to small polyps and (in CT) expose healthy subjects to undue radiation. However, better oral MRI contrast agents might also be developed by linking our Gadolinium-DOTA-sucrose-derived agent to tumor targeted ligands. These molecules might build up at the tumor site, allowing for enhanced non-invasive imaging of previously undetectable small or flat polyps.",Healthcare Portfolios

Method for Guiding Cell Spreading in Automated Cytogenetics Assays,This invention presents a method and system for overcoming some of the intrinsic limitations that automated cytogenetic assays have by establishing a model whose parameters can be analyzed and controlled suitable for an automated system. The ability of characterizing fluid behavior at a scale comparable to the size of cells by interference fringes is expected to facilitate further understanding of the metaphase spreading process at micro- and nano- scale.,"Although the image analysis of chromosomes and other cellular components can be automated for high throughput cytogenetic assay processing, its sample preparation step is a limiting empirical and labor intensive step. Dynamics of methanol and acetic acid (3: 1 v:v) fixative sessile drop is important for metaphase chromosomal spreads in cytogenetic assays. There are also other types of solvents mixtures reported in the prior art for facilitating and speeding the process, but it is still not fully understood and characterized from a physical science perspective for automated processing.",Research Tools
A Flexible Virtual Network with FIB Aggregation,"The technique of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) aggregation reduces FIB size by combining entries whose prefixes are numerically aggregatable and whose next hops are the same. It is a software solution that can be applied to a single router without upgrading the hardware, changing the control plane, or affecting packets’ forwarding paths. Thus it can be deployed incrementally and selectively in a network at operators’ discretion.","Routers exchange information using routing protocols to route packets through the network. The exchanged information is stored in a Routing Information Base (RIB), which stores all IP routing information, and is responsible for next-hop selection. The router processes information in the RIB to determine how to forward packets from the router, with this information stored in a forwarding information base (FIB). The FIB in routers contains a subset of the RIB information, such as the address prefixes and their select next hops, for fast lookup during data forwarding. In the core of the network, it is possible for the FIB to contain hundreds of thousands of entries (e.g. one for each route in the FIB). Once the FIB becomes so large that it can no longer fit in the fast memory of routers’ line cards, ISPs have to upgrade their line cards, eventually making internet services more expensive.",Software & Information Technology

Emotional awareness is conceptualized as a cognitive skill that varies between individuals in the degree to which it has developed. People vary from one another in their typical level of emotional awareness. The five levels of emotional awareness are: 1) physical sensations, 2) action tendencies, 3) single emotions, 4) blends of emotions, and 5) blends of blends of emotions. The scale poses evocative interpersonal situations and elicits open-ended descriptions of the emotional responses of self and others which are scored using specific structural criteria applied to the emotion words used in the responses.

A Streamlined Process to Generate Nitroaromatic Compounds,"This invention is a new, one-step, streamlined synthetic process used in the nitration of aromatic compounds. In practice, this novel synthetic method has been used to prepare 2,4-dinitroanisole, a high energy compound with superior resistance to heat and shock. This compound can have uses in the mining and construction industries (roads, bridges, etc.). Other compounds that can be formed using the invented reaction include: nitrobenzene, which can be used as an ingredient in analgesics; dinitroltoluene, which is a common plasticizer; dinitronaphthalene, which can be used as a dye; and dinitrophenol, which can be used as an herbicide.","Methods for nitration of aromatic compounds often include additives, such as zeolites, putative catalysts, and are carried out in a non-participatory solvent.

The Fluorescence Emission Spectrometer (FLORES),"This invention discloses a high resolution spectrometer (resolving power &gt;20,000) that can resolve individual Fraunhofer absorption lines in the solar spectrum. When in Earth orbit the image of the surface on the entrance slit of the spectrometer is swept along perpendicular to the spacecraft motion such that the ground resolution along the slit equals the forward motion of the slit in a single integration time. The solar absorption lines are so deep that the spectrometer with its high signal to noise ratio can sense the emitted fluorescence caused by photons released during photosynthesis (1-2% of the reflected sunlight). Directly sensing plant fluorescence and therefore, sensing photosynthesis in action allows for the rapid measurement of plant health and the effects of various stressors on the fixation of carbon into the plant structure.","Plant fluorescence and the advantages of sensing it using Fraunhofer lines has been known for years, however, the challenge has been to design an instrument that can measure the faint signals in the presence of full sunlight from space orbit. Space measurements to date have used only a few solar absorption lines or an oxygen absorption band near 760 nm, which does not allow for significant clarity or area of sensing.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Targeted Drug Delivery to the Lower GI Tract,"This technology is a new, orally administered pro-drug form of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) that has been developed and successfully demonstrated. This invention relates generally to the field of medicine, and more specifically to methods and compositions for targeted delivery of substances to the lower GI tract. The invention has particular utility for delivery of drugs for treating or preventing diseases of the colon, and in particular, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome and will be described in connection with such utility, although other utilities are contemplated.","Millions of people in the world suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a collective term used to describe two gastrointestinal disorders of unknown etiology; Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Both diseases appear to result from the unrestrained activation of an inflammatory response in the intestine. Ulcerative colitis occurs in the large intestine, while Crohn’s disease can involve the entire gastrointestinal tract, as well as the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of IBD is multifactorial involving susceptibility genes and environmental factors. Although the causative triggers remain unclear, the role of a persistent and likely dysregulated mucosal immune response is central to the pathogenesis of IBD. It remains unclear whether the persistent inflammation, an intrinsic feature of IBD, reflects a primary aberration in mucosal response or results from an inappropriate persistent stimulation.",Life Sciences
Combining Phase Measurements from Multiple MRI Channels,"This technology is the combination of multiple measurements obtained from different receive coils (channels) of an MR system to provide improved signal (SNR) via the improved sensitivity profile. The invention consists of an optimizer which determines the values of the echo time steps and the parameters of the post-processing algorithm. This optimizer need only to be run once, offline prior to subsequent further acquisition.","Magnetic Resonance with multi-channel phase reconstruction presents a difficult challenge because different channels have arbitrary phase offsets. The phase offset is spatially varying making combining complex data from multiple channels difficult to perform accurately. In MRI, there are multiple coils (channels) that acquire phase around the organ of interest, for better coverage. The issue is, each of these channels have their own phase, and are out of phase from one another. That is, each channel measures a phase that is offset from the other channel's phase. And to make it worse, this phase offset changes across the image, so calibration is practically out of the question.",Imaging & Optics
"Optimization of Electrical Stimulation of Biological Material (e.g., Neurons) for Artificial Vision and other Neural Stimulation Applications.","(UA13-019 and UA13-025) This invention proposes a number of improvements for retinal stimulation. These include: (1) a time profile for the electric stimulation field that leads predominantly to transverse stimulation of retinal nerve cells; (2) auxiliary electric fields for field shaping with a time profile chosen such that these currents have small probability to cause undesired cross-talk stimulation of adjacent nerve cells; and (3) a local area scanning procedure that results in high pixel density for highly spatially resolved, i.e., discrete, image/percept formation. In addition, a stochastic optimization framework is discussed that can be employed to achieve optimal field shaping with a given electrode array chip. This invention can be applied to a broad range of neural stimulation applications including deep brain, spinal cord, sacral nerve, vagus nerve, gastric areas, cortical areas, and the retina.","
Research on retinal implants has been ongoing for about two decades. The thrust of the research is to restore at least small, central part of vision to people suffering from blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Electrical stimulation of retinal tissue is a non-linear, highly complex process. The reason is that biological tissue (and nerve cells within) is a very complicated electric conductor. It is partly an electrolyte, partly an insulator, partly a colloid. It contains macromolecules with various polarizabilities, and it has a complicated spatial structure/arrangement, with cells and clefts in between the cells.

Systems and Methods for Improving the Performance of a Photorefractive Device,"This invention provides a method for improving the performance of a photorefractive device comprising one or more transparent electrode layers and a photorefractive material. The method comprises interposing one or more polymer layers between the transparent electrode layer and the photorefractive material. In an embodiment, the peak diffraction efficiency bias of the photorefractive device after incorporating the one or more polymer layers in the photorefractive device is reduced when measured by using an approximately 532 nm laser beam, relative to a photorefractive device containing at least one transparent electrode layer and a photorefractive material without a polymer layer interposed there between.","Photorefractivity is a phenomenon in which the refractive index of a material can be altered by changing the electric field within the material, such as by laser beam irradiation. The change of the refractive index is achieved by a series of steps, including: (1) charge generation by laser irradiation, (2) charge transport, resulting in the separation of positive and negative charges, (3) trapping of one type of charge (charge delocalization), (4) formation of a nonuniform internal electric field (space-charge field) as a result of charge delocalization, and (5) refractive index change induced by the non-uniform electric field. Therefore, good photorefractive properties can generally be seen in materials that combine good charge generation, good charge transport or photoconductivity, and good electro-optical activity. In recent years, efforts have been made to optimize the properties of organic, and particularly polymeric, photorefractive materials. Good photorefractive properties depend upon good charge generation, good charge transport, also known as photoconductivity, and good electro-optical activity. Various studies have been performed to examine the selection and combination of the components that give rise to each of these features. Typically, a high biased voltage can be applied to photorefractive materials in order to obtain good photorefractive behavior. While using a high biased voltage can result in a longer grating persistency, the use of a high voltage in the photorefractive material can cause the photorefractive grating to disappear almost immediately after stopping the applied biased voltage. Therefore, there is a strong need to improve grating holding persistency, even if the biased voltage is stopped and no voltage is being applied.

Antimicrobial Efficacy of Treatments Based on Plant Compounds,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have demonstrated synergistic effects of silver and natural plant antimicrobials resulting in an effective, inexpensive, safe treatment with a wide variety of potential applications. Silver may be used as an alternative disinfectant in applications in which the use of traditional disinfectants such as chlorine may result in the formation of toxic by-products or cause corrosion of surfaces.","While the U.S. has one of the safest food supplies in the world, food safety remains of critical importance to consumers because foodborne infections afflict millions of people each year costing billions of dollars in medical costs and productivity losses. There is a need for new technologies to enhance the safety of the food supply by controlling foodborne pathogens.

Over the past several decades, silver has been introduced as an antimicrobial in numerous applications such as water treatment, in dietary supplements, in medical applications, and to produce antimicrobial coatings and products.",Agriculture & Horticulture
Plant Antimicrobial Washes for Use on Organic Leafy Greens,"Faculty at the University of Arizona are developing an antimicrobial wash solution for organic leafy greens by utilizing three plant essential oil formulations. The plant oils used for this invention are food compatible, natural and considered as generally safe. This technology is highly effective against antibiotic resistant salmonella enterica on organic leafy greens than current hydrogen peroxide or chlorine treatments being used. Inventors plan to test these antimicrobial on semi-commercial scale to determine if they are equally effective and plan to investigate combinations of the antimicrobials.","Salmonella enterica has caused many foodborne illness outbreaks following the consumption of contaminated produce. To solve the issue chlorine or hydrogen peroxide are used as antimicrobial washes on fruit and vegetables. This procedure is harsh on produce and bad for human consumption. With more and more antibiotic resistance of foodborne pathogens, there has been a growing demand for alternative safe and natural antimicrobial washes for food products. Essential oils are known to exhibit antimicrobial properties.

Combination Treatment for Cancer Involving CX-3543 and a PARP Inhibitor,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have discovered that the addition of benzamide to HeLA cells prior to treatment with CX-3543 results in an increase in nucleolin bound to the NHE III1 element of the c-Myc promoter. Further analysis of the data indicated that there is a significant increase in the induction of apoptosis over that of CX-3543 alone. This suggests that the combined use of Cylene Pharmaceutical's CX-3543 and a PARP inhibitor should show produce greater efficacy than the use of CX-3543 alone. Also, it is anticipated that the spectrum of tumors to which this method of treatment is amenable will increase enabling administration to a wider range of tumor types than previous procedures.","Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme that functions in repairing DNA, mediating cell death, and regulating the immune response. PARP is activated as a result of cellular damage resulting from chemotherapy, radiotherapy radiation therapy, stroke, head trauma or ischemia. Previously, the use of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of cancer has required its combined use with alkylating agents such as radiation in order to be effective resulting in undesirable side effects. Combining the use of a PARP inhibitor with another efficacy increasing agent would enable more effective treatment with fewer side effects.",Life Sciences
Modified Veress Needle for Tension Pneumothorax Decompression,"Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed a Modified Veress Needle (mVN) that has several design and functional advantages compared to the 14-gauge needle thoracostomy (NT) for treating tension pneumothorax (tPTX), including an indicator element to know the position of the needle. The inventors demonstrated the effectiveness of their design through a cross-over swine model of 43 tPTX events in which mVN resulted in 100% successful decompression within 70±86seconds and NT resulted in 21% successful decompression within 157±96seconds.","Tension pneumothorax (tPTX) is a life-threatening condition that is present in 0.2-1.7% of civilian trauma patients and up to 4% of battlefield casualties. It results from laceration to the lung, creating a parenchymal air leak with no means of evacuation. Consequently, the patient manifests with severe hypoxia, hypercarbia, and cardiovascular collapse as increasing pressure in the hemithorax creates ipsilateral lung collapse and impedance of venous return to the heart. Current standard pre-hospital treatment of tPTX, as described in the 9th edition of the Advance Trauma Life Support Student Course manual, is immediate decompression by inserting a large caliber needle, 5cm 14-gauge angiocatheter, into the second intercostal space of the effected hemithorax. This technique has failure rates ranging from 40-64%. In 1938, Veress developed a needle with a spring-loaded obturator that allowed safe insertion and insufflation of the peritoneal cavity. Thereafter, pneumoperitoneum was established prior to instrumentation of the abdomen.",Medical Devices
Grid-Based Robust Field Map Estimation without the Noise-Bandwidth Trade-Off,"The present invention is a new MRI acquisition that does not suffer from the noise-bandwidth trade-off commonly seen in current MRI measurement devices. This trade-off measuring seen in large range of inhomogeneity values will suffer from high levels of noise resulting in unreliable estimates of measurement. Accurate results are only guaranteed over a small range of inhomogeneity values. The method collects three Gradient-Recalled Echo (GRE) images at three different echo times. That is, one additional GRE acquisition (i.e. less than half a second longer), in comparison to traditional field map estimation methods. The associated estimation algorithm (processing software) is optimally tuned to this engineered acquisition and returns field map estimates that have a pre-determined accuracy over this arbitrary bandwidth. These acquisition and processing parameters are jointly optimized offline based on the tissue/material of interest.","Rapid MRI acquisitions with long read out times suffer from artifacts due to inherent magnetic field imperfections, or inhomogeneities. These inhomogeneities are a function of the hardware (magnets), electronics (switching gradient of the MR) and, more importantly, the underlying physiology (air/bone/fluid interfaces, chemical composition, etc). The resulting artifacts, such as signal loss and geometric distortion worsen with higher field MRI machines.",Imaging & Optics
Patternable Circular Color Polarizer and Filter Based on Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Polymer,This technology consists of a process to fabricate micro-polarizer and wave plate based on nematic liquid crystals. University of Arizona inventors have improved upon that technology and have identified a process to create a circular polarizer for various visible wavelengths using a cholesteric liquid crystal (ch-LCP).,"Linear micropolarizer arrays have been fabricated using a variety of techniques including; etched dichroic polymers, wire-grid polarizers, liquid crystal (LC) arrays, and photo aligned liquid crystal polymers (LCP). Unfortunately, these techniques are exclusively applied to the fabrication of linearly polarized elements. Making circular and elliptical polarization elements are more difficult to construct. A circular polarizer can be constructed by using a multilayer structure, such as the combination of a wave plate, a linear polarizer and absorbent dyes. The wire-grid polarizer technology is not easily extended to non-linear polarization, therefore liquid crystal polymers mixed with chiral dopants, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystal polymers can be an effective and potentially simpler alternative for creating patterned non-linear polarized optical devices. Like nematic liquid crystals, cholesteric liquid crystals can be photo-aligned using techniques such as atomic force microscopes, and ion beams. Although, these techniques can be easily extended to cholesteric liquid crystals, they are not conducive for large areas. To photo-align cholesteric liquid crystals on large areas, implementing the use of polarized light would be effective because polarized light has been demonstrated to fabricate linear polarizers of sizes as small as 4um over large areas.",Imaging & Optics
Early Assessment of Biophysical Parameters Predicts Lesion Formation During RF Energy Delivery,"Lesion size or volume prediction shortly after the beginning of an ablation procedure can inform and/or control the ablation process. The prediction and/or control is made without regard to an actual detected temperature in the vicinity of the ablation electrodes. As a consequence, the system has utility with irrigated catheter constructions and other situations in which local irrigation in the vicinity of an ablation site would otherwise interfere with a prediction or control scheme that solely relies upon temperature measurements.","Radio frequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure used to treat a medical disorder where part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, tumor or other dysfunctional tissue is ablated using the heat generated from a high frequency alternating current. Cardiac arrhythmias that originate from a focal area or depend upon a discrete circuit can be eliminated by catheter ablation. Various energy sources are utilized for this purpose of which radio frequency (RF) energy of 200 kHz-500 kHz is most commonly employed and is delivered to electrodes on the tip of a catheter. Heating occurs due to power dissipation within the tissue of the energy delivered by the electrodes.

Snapshot Spatial Heterodyne Imaging Polarimetry,"A real time imaging Stokes polarimeter that is able to render the full linear polarization profile of a scene without the need for computational support has been designed the University of Arizona. This polarization imaging is achieved through an advanced optical design that requires no moving parts. It uses the full spectral content of a scene to form a polarization image. Electronically active components such as CCD’s or phosphorescent screens can be implemented to enable video capture or snapshot imaging, but such is not a requirement. This allows the technology to be implemented in both active and passive optical setups. Also, the design is adaptable for handheld use, making it an excellent candidate for utility grade implementation in any environment where polarimetric imaging is needed.","In any given scene, a wealth of hidden information can be unveiled through polarization imaging. Polarimeters can be used to evaluate large regions of material or terrain for materials inspection or target identification. The ability to acquire this information quickly allows this modality to be used in scenes that change quickly in time, and many types of polarimeters have been designed to accomplish this goal. However, few are able to render the polarization information without computer control. Either image post-processing is required, or advanced control of optical components is needed. The ability to render polarization information from a scene without the assistance of a computer implies a design that has no moving parts and that can be implemented passively. Such technology would enable the adaptation of polarimetric imaging to many forms ranging from microscopes to rifle scopes. Furthermore, capturing this information across a wide spectral band would provide an ideal polarimeter that is capable of making full use of the spectral content within a scene.",Imaging & Optics
Compact Spatial Heterodyne Interferometer,This invention is a novel miniaturized spatial heterodyne interferometers (SHI) design that overcomes problems with thermal effects and also maintains low cost for the infrared regime. This system is a more robust SHI that can be implemented in many wavelength regimes without substantial change to the materials used. The design also has multiple implementations that allow further tradeoffs between size and costs for improved adaptability.,"For applications where high-resolution spectral analysis is required, spatial heterodyne interferometers (SHIs) can be used for obtaining near sub-angstrom spectral resolution. This capability finds use in fields such as atmospheric sciences and biomedical imaging. A basic implementation of an SHI setup looks similar to a Michelson interferometer, but to make these instruments more amenable for use in compact devices, miniaturization is required. Prior attempts to miniaturize the Michelson SHI design have led to problems with thermal effects as well as increased cost, especially for infrared systems, which require advanced optical materials for directing the light. A departure from the standard Michelson SHI implementation has led to less dependence on wavelength regime as well as cheaper costs for miniaturization.",Imaging & Optics
Tissue Characterization with Partial Volume Correction Using Highly Undersampled Data and a Joint Fitting Algorithm,"This technology provides techniques to a fast and accurate parameter estimation in the presence of partial volume from MRI data acquired. A specific technique application for liver lesion imaging is provided in this invention. The inventors employ Joint Bi-Exponential Fitting (JBF) algorithm in context of T2 estimation for small structure determination within background, overcoming the partial volume effect.","While MRI technical improvements have transformed this modality for clinical application over the past 15 years, there remains a number of pressing technical requirements for a more extensive use in clinical applications. A major aim in MRI development is the need to achieve shorter acquisition times, particularly for imaging tissues that move (as a result from physiological effects such as respiration) or in types of imaging where obtaining the required information involves long acquisition times rendering the method impractical under clinical conditions. The goal of quantitative imaging modalities is to estimate a parameter that is associated with a specific property of the sample being imaged. Because samples of clinical or industrial importance are typically made up of more than one component, parameter estimation typically involves algorithms that can handle multi-component data. Conventional multiple component parameter fitting algorithms, however, are affected by the level of noise in the measurement data set yielding large uncertainties of the estimated parameter.",Imaging & Optics

Assuming that man-made targets are dominated by few strong scatterers, the invention sets up a reconstruction manifold based on phase histories of scatterers at different points within the illumination beam. The invention then uses a sparse reconstruction technique to obtain images of higher resolution than would typically be possible using SAR processing on the same data. The image allows better estimation of angle to the target than what is usually obtained via monopulse techniques.",Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar whose defining characteristic is its use of relative motion between an antenna and its target region.

Automatic RF Match Control Circuit for Broadband and Reconfigurable Wireless Devices,"The bandwidth of most wireless devices is governed by the antenna's input impedance or by the impedance match between critical devices. Often, it is the antenna's reactance rather than the resistance that varies with frequency, so tuning complex impedance to purely real impedance over a broad frequency band can be quite difficult. This invention relaxes some of the design requirements of the antenna, with an intermediate matching circuit with automatic leveling and tuning. This automatic match control circuit (AMC), which employs varactor diodes for their tunability and availability, requires two parts: a tuner, and a feedback circuit that will sense the mismatch and provide the voltage correction bias to the tuner elements in order to achieve low mismatch. The AMC can dynamically reconfigure the spectral masks of the input match as a function of frequency and can correct for high VSWR effects on the outputs of power amplifiers by intelligently modifying the reactance of the circuit.","Everyday the world's wireless communication systems mature and expand and the demand for improved, lower-cost portable wireless devices increases.

Novel Approach for Making Optical Fibers,"Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences have developed a means of increasing power output in single mode fiber lasers by significantly increasing the mode area available for doping, thus providing higher power in shorter fiber lasers. Instead of the conventional refractive index relationship between the cladding (outer) region and the core (inner) region of the fiber, a material of lower refractive index is used in the core region. This approach significantly lowers control and fabrication tolerances, thus lowering the total cost of production.  Using a novel geometry of ""holey fibers"", also called ""photonic crystal fibers"" (PCF), the invention is a low-cost approach to the design and manufacture of waveguides for optical switching, high-speed data transmission, laser surgery, and welding applications.","The field of high-power fiber lasers hits limitations with conventional single-mode step-index fibers because the high ion doping concentrations needed for high power require a long length of fiber, making it difficult to maintain a single mode. Shorter lengths of fiber can remain single mode, but can only achieve powers in the milliwatt range because the short length cannot support sufficient ion doping concentrations to achieve higher power. Part of the problem is due to the small mode area of single-mode step-index fibers.",Imaging & Optics

Process to Fabricate Light Sources that Emit Polarized Light,"A new technology for creating polarized illumination sources that are small, have controllable spectral outputs, and that can be arranged into a microarray of polarization sources. This technology aligns molecules of photoactive dye in a liquid crystal polymer host to produce light with a degree of polarization of about 0.5. The molecules can be aligned locally across a large area to produce a micro polarization array if desired. The type of luminescent molecule used determines the source bandwidth.","Manipulation of light polarization is becoming increasingly important in many optical systems. As optical technologies ranging from digital displays to photolithography continue to grow, there comes a greater need to not only control polarization, but also to provide polarized illumination for such devices. Polarized sources are able to provide further improvements in performance and efficiency. Few types of polarized sources already exist, such as lasers, but their size and cost often limit their applications of use. Lasers are particularly limited in their spectral output as well as their ability to locally control polarization states across a wide area. Thus, there exists a need for polarization sources that are compact, have controllable spectral outputs, and that can be engineered to provide polarization control on a localized level.",Imaging & Optics
Non-Mechanical Auto-Focus and Optical Zoom,"A design for a non-mechanical zoom system using variable focus elements without moving parts to create optically zoomed images has been developed by researchers at the University of Arizona. Three different magnifications have been demonstrated, and unlike digital zoom, enhanced detail is presented to the detector for improved imaging. The variable focus elements are electronically controlled using low voltages, allowing the system to be integrated readily into electronic devices.","Zoom systems are useful in imaging applications to collect extra-fine detail of scenes or objects. Many camera systems used today implement a feature called digital zoom, but digital zoom is only computer-generated and does not increase the detail of the captured image. Optical zoom, however, delivers enhanced detail to the image itself, but conventional systems require moving parts in order to incorporate this function. Zoom systems are therefore generally more complicated and expensive and are not well suited for compact imaging systems such as cameras in cell phones. Non-mechanical zoom systems have better potential for implementation in imaging systems where compactness and simplicity are crucial.",Imaging & Optics
Novel Method of Generating Nearly Non-Diffracting Beams,Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a method to efficiently generate high power Bessel-like beams using methods that are significantly simpler than those commonly used. The new method allows fine tailoring of output beam characteristics and works over a large range of wavelengths or with white light sources. This novel method provides a wide range of output power from milliwatts up to tens of watts.,"Non-diffracting and ""self-healing"" Bessel beams have attracted great interest because of their invariant propagation properties. Bessel beams play an important role in optical acceleration, particle guiding and manipulation, imaging, microfabrication, nonlinear optics, and lithography. In comparison to Gaussian beams, Bessel beams do not diverge with propagation and maintain higher power for longer propagation distances. The conventional techniques for generating them require bulk optics, free space elements or careful alignment. Although there are some efforts in compact generating techniques, such as microaxicons and fiber Bragg gratings, these techniques still require a costly manufacturing process and special equipment.",Imaging & Optics
Extremely Rapid and Fully Reprogrammable Total PCR Assays Using Wire-Guided Droplet Microfluidics,"This technology comprises a reprogrammable digital microfluidics assembly, called wire-guided droplet microfluidics, wherein a droplet hangs at the end of a wire or a blunt end syringe needle and moves either over a superhydrophobic surface or within a hydrophobic liquid. The differences in the forces of adhesion to the needle wire and to the superhydrophobic surface/liquid enables the movements of a droplet following the movements of the needle wire. The wire-guided droplet microfluidics, is totally reprogrammable and simple enough to be fabricated into a handheld device that can be used in field situations. The whole processes of PCR assay can be performed in a single device without using any human labor.

The problem of these attempts is that the user cannot change the assay protocol or chip architecture easily.,Life Sciences
Fault- and Variation-Tolerant Energy- and Area-Efficient Links for Network-on-Chips (NoCs),Researchers in the University of Arizona's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering developed an enhancement to the Inter-Router Dual-Function Energy and Area Efficient Links (iDEAL) design for Network-on-Chips (NoC). This development adds dynamic error correction and fault-tolerance capability to the iDEAL design scheme and overcomes many disadvantages present in traditional error-correction schemes while achieving low-latency and low power consumption.,"This enhancement to the Inter-Router Dual-Function Energy and Area Efficient Links (iDEAL) design for Network-on-Chips (NoC) adds dynamic error correction and fault-tolerance capability to the iDEAL design. This enhancement maintains the advantages of the iDEAL design, such as low power consumption without degraded performance, while improving signal integrity and reliability. By deploying circuit-level enhancements to the original iDEAL design, error recovery is achieved even when downstream data propagation congestion exists. Further improvements assist to avoid data flow stalls and improve throughput while employing a dynamic boosting scheme that further improves data-flow speed. These techniques provide robust error recovery and improve the performance of the iDEAL and other NoC architectures.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Queral Networks,"This technology is a new model of computation leveraging the power of the networked, parallelized structure of neural networks and the basic operations of computers that are termed the ""Queron"". The Queron would be considered a generalization of the neuron and Queral Networks a generalization of computation and ANNs. Querons are capable of connecting and listening to other Querons based on their input requirements and will allow incoming connections from other Querons in the same manner. This will allow for massive parallelization currently absent from current solutions.","Traditionally Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnecting artificial neurons programmed to mimic the properties of biological neurons. The individual neurons in an ANN have been extensively investigated and ANNs have been developed which can perform very complex computations. Even so, current ANN models are not highly parallelized in the same way organic neural networks are and therefore are unable to match their computational power.",Software & Information Technology
Carbon Nanostructure Synthesis from Carbon-Excess Explosives in Supercrital Fluid,"This invention relates to the synthesis of carbon nanostructures such as graphene, fullerenes and nano-tubes, and more particular to the synthesis of such nanostructures from carbon-excess explosives in supercritical fluid.","Carbon nanostructures are synthesized from carbon-excess explosives having a negative oxygen balance. A supercritical fluid provides an environment that safely dissolves and decomposes the explosive molecules into its reactant products including activated C or CO and provides the temperature and pressure for the required collision rate of activated C atoms and CO molecules to form carbon nanostructures such as graphene, fullerenes and nanotubes. The nanostructures may be synthesized without a metal reactant at relatively low temperatures in the supercritical fluid to provide a cost effective path to bulk fabrication. These nanostructures may be synthesized “metal free”. As the supercritical fluid provides an inert buffer that does not react with the explosive, the fluid is preserved. Once the nanostructures are removed, the other reaction products may be removed and the fluid recycled.",Materials
Carbon Ion Beam Growth of Isotopically-Enriched Graphene and Isotope-Junctions,Isotopically-enriched graphene and isotope junctions are epitaxially grown on a catalyst substrate using a focused carbon ion beam technique. The focused carbon ion beam is filtered to pass substantially a single ion species including a single desired carbon isotope. The ion beam and filtering together provide a means to selectively isotopically-enrich the epitaxially grown graphene from given carbon precursor and to selectively deposit graphene enriched with different carbon isotopes in different regions.,"Graphene is a one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp2 -bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb, hexagonal crystal lattice. Graphene is a basic building block for graphitic materials of all other dimensionalities. Graphene can be wrapped up into 0D fullerenes, rolled into 1D nanotubes or stacked into 3D graphite. Graphene has rather remarkable properties. Graphene is stable, chemically inert, and crystalline under ambient conditions. It is a semimetal in that its conduction and valence bands just meet at discrete points in the Brillouin zone. An electron in graphene has an effective mass of zero and behaves more like a photon than a conventional massive particle. Finally, graphene can carry huge current densities--about 108 A/cm2, roughly two orders of magnitude greater than copper. Graphene is a candidate for replacing silicon as a basis for faster, more powerful electronics. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are essentially single layers of graphene that are cut in a particular pattern to give it certain electrical properties.",Materials
Isotope Junctions Created in Carbon Nanotubes for Spintronic Applications,"This invention relates to nanotube (NT) growth of carbon and other materials using an ion implantation process, and more particular to the growth of nanotubes with a specified isotope composition using a selection filter and catalytic transmembrane. An ion source(s) is configured to generate ions from one or more elements including a plurality of different isotopes or unique molecular combinations of two or more different isotopes from at least one of the selected elements. A selection filter(s) directs a subset of the ions onto a catalytic transmembrane to grow nanotubes of a specific isotope composition on the opposite side of the transmembrane. The nanotubes may be uniformly or selectively doped with dopant atoms. A controller can configure the selection filter(s) to sequentially pass different subsets of ions to form isotope, molecular or element junctions in the growing nanotubes.","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have stimulated a great deal of interest in the microelectronic and other industries because of their unique properties including tensile strengths above 35 GPa, elastic modulus reaching 1 TPa, higher thermal conductivity than diamond, ability to carry 1000x the current of copper, densities below 1.3 g/cm3 and high chemical, thermal and radiation stability. CNTs have great promise for devices such as field effect transistors, field emission displays, single electron transistors in the microelectronic industry, and uses in other industries. Commercialization of CNTs will depend in large part on the ability to grow and network CNTs on a large cost-effective scale without compromising these properties.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Organic Solar Cells Based on a Solution Phase Near-IR Absorbing Soluble Phthalocyanines,"This invention is a solution-processed planar heterojunction (PHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) device based on a soluble titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) derivative as the donor with photo activity extended up to 1 micron in the near-IR region of the solar spectrum, without significantly affecting the open-circuit photopotential (Voc). TiOPc is a metallated phthalocyanine bearing a Ti=O bond orthogonal to the molecular plane. The presence of the dipole in the axial direction leads to a face-to-face arrangement of the molecules which maximizes the p-orbital overlap. Depending on the degree of p -orbital overlap in the condensed phase, TiOPc can exist in polymorphs such as Phase-I (or b-phase) and Phase-II (a-phase) that are active in the near-IR. A direct consequence of such an arrangement is high photoconductivity, third order non-linear susceptibility, and near-IR absorptivity that makes this material and invention a promising candidate for advanced technologies such as OPV and optical limiting devices.","The solar cells in this invention convert sunlight in the near-IR region of the solar spectrum to electricity, and they are constructed from soluble small molecule, rather than polymer, donor materials. The efficiency of organic solar cells is limited by the number of photons absorbed within the active layer thickness, which is confined to the visible region for most chromophores while 50% of the AM1.5G solar irradiance is incident in the near-IR region. If thin-film absorptivities can be extended to the near-IR with no significant loss in the Voc, a significant improvement in power conversion efficiencies (h) can be anticipated. Solution-processed small-molecules as donors have been a subject of several recent investigations due to their facile synthesis, purification, tunability, and inherent monodispersity. Unlike vacuum deposition, which is still the predominant mode of film-deposition, solution-processable chromophores can deposit thin-films over large areas using techniques such as reel-to-reel wet coating, ink-jet printing, and spin-coating.",Materials
Peripheral and Non-Peripheral Substituted Phthalocyanines,"This invention is directed to phthalocyanine chromophores with chalcogen based substituents on the peripheral and non-peripheral positions - phthalocyanine chromophores that have alkylthio (i.e., RS-) and alkoxy (i.e. RO-) on the peripheral (2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24) and nonperipheral (1,4,8,11,15,16,22,25) positions of the macrocyclic ring.","The solar cells in the current invention convert sunlight in the near-IR region of the solar spectrum to electricity, and they are constructed from soluble small molecule, rather than polymer, donor materials. An Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) device efficiency can be significantly improved if the optical absorption of the active-layer is extended to the near-IR region of the solar spectrum, where most solar photons are incident, without sacrificing the VOC.",Materials
Solution Processed Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Based on Near-IR Absorbing Soluble Phthalocyanines,"This invention demonstrates excellent near-IR photoactivity for solution-processed Bulk Heterojunction (BHJ) OPV device.

Molecular Thermoelectric Device,"Peltier coolers (which utilize the thermoelectric effect) have found their way to market very specific applications. These current devices, however, are inefficient and costly. ZT is a dimensionless figure of merit typically used to evaluate the performance of thermoelectric systems. Most of the devices mentioned above have a ZT≈1. So far, only ZT≈3 has been achieved in the lab. In order for a thermoelectric material to have broad commercial applicability, it must have a ZT≥4. The simulations and projections developed by University of Arizona researchers demonstrate that ZT&gt;4 is achievable through the use of polyphenyl ether molecules sandwiched between two electrodes. Polyphenyl ether is, essentially, a chain of benzene rings each connected asymmetrically. Because of the asymmetric connection, electricity has a longer path to travel in one direction around the aromatic ring than the other. This results in destructive interference. When a temperature gradient exists between the two electrodes, however, the effect essentially amplifies voltage and mitigates the effects of entropy, resulting in an efficiency much closer to Carnot efficiency (the theoretical efficiency limit for any energy conversion system) and a ZT&gt;4.","Thermoelectric materials have long held the promise to revolutionize commercial applications such as power generation, heat management, and cooling. To date, however, proposed thermoelectric systems have proved to be relatively inefficient and expensive. Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a thermoelectric material with high efficiency and low cost that will make this technology widely viable for commercial applications for the first time.",Engineering & Physical Sciences
Fabrication of Pillared Graphene,"This invention is a method of fabricating pillared graphene. This is accomplished by first constraining a layer of fullerenes between graphene sheets (the proto structure). Tether molecules may be employed to help chemically bind the fullerenes to the graphene at attachment points. Energy is applied to the proto structure via chemical reaction, thermal or radiative processes to break the carbon-carbon double bonds and open holes in the fullerenes and the graphene sheets at the attachment points. The fullerenes and graphene near the attachment points reorganize their carbon-carbon bonds via cycloaddition. The reactions resulting in establishment of fullerene to graphene bonds around the perimeter of the holes and reorganization of their carbon-carbon bonds to form open nanotubes that are conjoined between the pair of graphene sheets in a pillared graphene nanostructure. Energy for bond reorganization may come from either chemical reaction of the tether molecules with other chemical species present during fabrication, and/or from adsorption or scattering of energetic atom, electron or photon radiation to which the proto structure is exposed.","This invention relates to 3-D nanostructures, and more particularly to the fabrication of pillared graphene.

Process to Fabricate Micro-Polarizers and Waveplates on Sensor Array,"Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a fabrication process to create patterned polarizers for various visible wavelengths using dichroic dye in a liquid crystal polymer (LCP) host directly on an array of optical sensors. This invention uses  multiple layers of an LPP/LCP system to create more complex polarization elements such as color circular polarizers, waveplates of arbitrary retardance, and linear and circular polarizers. The process is simple and inexpensive compared to other micropolarizer systems.","Patterned polarizers have a variety of applications in polarimetry, interferometry, three dimensional displays, and optical data storage. Wire-grid polarizers are by far the most common commercial products for infrared applications; however, micropatterned wire-grid polarizers have limited spatial resolution and poor performance at visible wavelengths, require complicated lithographic processing, are susceptible to defects and cannot be easily extended to non-linear polarizations. An alternative is the photo alignment of absorbing materials which can produce micron sized polarizers of high efficiency and extinction for ultra violet (UV), visible, and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. While smaller resolution alignment has been demonstrated, it is impractical for large areas.",Imaging & Optics
Ultra-Compact Snapshot Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer,"This invention is a novel device that answers challenges of increased robustness and faster acquisition time. This new device has no moving mechanical parts, mounts directly onto the focal plane imaging array, and acquires both the spectral and spatial information at once. Thus, this new device is significantly more robust than its predecessors in the field, and it offers a true snapshot capability. Its form factor is also significantly reduced with respect to its predecessors. Furthermore, due to the device’s passive design, it does not require any power to operate beyond what is needed for the image capture and signal processing hardware.","Today’s applications of remote sensing demand information of increasing sophistication. In particular, there is a need to obtain detailed spatial and spectral information over a short period of time (e.g., to counter motion blur). Though a number of imaging spectrometer technologies have emerged in recent years, they are often technologically complex and lack the snapshot capability, which makes them susceptible to mechanical stress, vibration, and motion. Therefore, there is a need to develop imaging spectrometer hardware that is mechanically robust and features snapshot image acquisition.",Imaging & Optics
White Light Sagnac Interferometer,"This invention is a novel polarization imaging device that is simple, robust, and features a small form factor.

Information about the entire scene is captured at once, yielding fast, snapshot operation. All of this is accomplished in a compact package without any moving parts, requiring no extra power for its operation.","Collecting polarization data about an object can provide valuable information about it, such as distribution of internal stresses or whether the object is natural or man-made. As such polarization imaging devices are finding a broader range of applications, they are increasingly deployed outside of controlled environments, where the factors such as compactness and mechanical ruggedness become increasingly important. Therefore, there is a need to develop polarization imaging devices that are simple, robust, and feature a small form factor.",Imaging & Optics
Compact Snapshot Polarimetry Camera,"Researchers at The University of Arizona and Hokkaido University have developed a means for polarimetric analysis that completes a full polarimetric analysis in a single measurement without any moving parts. Using a combination of two pairs of Savart Plates with a half-wave plate between them, light passing through this system creates an interference pattern that can be detected using a conventional camera. The resulting interference pattern can then be analyzed from the camera image. The ability of using this compact snapshot system with conventional cameras greatly increases the number of applications for the technology.","As light interacts with objects in the environment, the polarization parameters of light are altered in a fashion directly related to the material composition, surface roughness, and shape of the objects. A man-made object has a different polarimetric image than a natural object, for example. Conventional polarimetric instruments take measurements by moving multiple polarization filters in front of the detector, requiring multiple measurements. This approach results in problems with vibration, heat generation, and spatial registration. Moving components also increase maintenance costs and points of system failure.",Imaging & Optics

A modulator applies stress to the fiber chain to induce birefringence and switch the cavity Q-factor to alternately store energy in the gain fiber and then release the energy in a laser pulse.","A fiber laser is a laser in which the active gain medium is an optical fiber doped with rare-earth element such as erbium, ytterbium, neodymium, dysprosium, praseodymium, and thulium. They are related to doped fiber amplifiers, which provide light amplification without lasing.
